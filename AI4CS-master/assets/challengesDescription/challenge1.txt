Oh no! You cat nemesis steal you bone from the matrix, you need to get all the fragments back!
But you need to save the bone on the cat's same game!
You will need to use a command to express disapproval of cats... The cat command!
Cat is used to read the content of a file, like this: cat my_file.txt
But how do you find the specified file? We'll see this in another challenge, now write cd ctf_workspace and then cat flag.txt
