### ls

## NAME

	 ls – list directory contents


## SYNOPSIS

	 ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when]
	[-D format] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
	 displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
	 each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
	 of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested,
	 associated information.

	 If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are
	 displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
	 displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted
	 separately and in lexicographical order.

	 The following options are available:

	 -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.

	 -A      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’)
		 except for . and ...  Automatically set for the super-user unless
		 -I is specified.

	 -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by
		 ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx,
		 where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.	This
		 option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
		 a terminal.

	 -D format
		 When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the
		 date and time output.  The argument format is a string used by
		 strftime(3).  Depending on the choice of format string, this may
		 result in a different number of columns in the output.  This
		 option overrides the -T option.  This option is not defined in
		 IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -F      Display a slash (‘/’) immediately after each pathname that is a
		 directory, an asterisk (‘*’) after each that is executable, an at
		 sign (‘@’) after each symbolic link, an equals sign (‘=’) after
		 each socket, a percent sign (‘%’) after each whiteout, and a
		 vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.

	 -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining
		 CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment and setting
		 --color=auto.  (See below.)  This functionality can be compiled
		 out by removing the definition of COLORLS.  This option is not
		 defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is
		 assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l options are specified.

	 -I      Prevent -A from being automatically set for the super-user.  This
		 option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -L      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or
		 directory the link references rather than the link itself.  This
		 option cancels the -P option.

	 -O      Include the file flags in a long (-l) output.  This option is
		 incompatible with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).  See
		 chflags(1) for a list of file flags and their meanings.

	 -P      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than
		 the object the link references.  This option cancels the -H and
		 -L options.

	 -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

	 -S      Sort by size (largest file first) before sorting the operands in
		 lexicographical order.

	 -T      When printing in the long (-l) format, display complete time
		 information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute,
		 second, and year.	The -D option gives even more control over the
		 output format.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std
		 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -U      Use time when file was created for sorting or printing.  This
		 option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -W      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.  This option is not
		 defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -X      When listing recursively, do not descend into directories that
		 would cross file system boundaries.  More specifically, this
		 option will prevent descending into directories that have a
		 different device number.

	 -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’).

	 -b      As -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible.  This option is
		 not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or
		 printing.

	 --color=when
		 Output colored escape sequences based on when, which may be set
		 to either always, auto, or never.

		 always will make ls always output color.  If TERM is unset or set
		 to an invalid terminal, then ls will fall back to explicit ANSI
		 escape sequences without the help of termcap(5).  always is the
		 default if --color is specified without an argument.

		 auto will make ls output escape sequences based on termcap(5),
		 but only if stdout is a tty and either the -G flag is specified
		 or the COLORTERM environment variable is set and not empty.

		 never will disable color regardless of environment variables.
		 never is the default when neither --color nor -G is specified.

		 For compatibility with GNU coreutils, ls supports yes or force as
		 equivalent to always, no or none as equivalent to never, and tty
		 or if-tty as equivalent to auto.

	 -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

	 -e      Print the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file, if
		 present, in long (-l) output.

	 -f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on -a.  It also negates
		 the effect of the -r, -S and -t options.  As allowed by IEEE Std
		 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”), this option has no effect on the -d, -l,
		 -R and -s options.

	 -g      This option has no effect.  It is only available for
		 compatibility with 4.3BSD, where it was used to display the group
		 name in the long (-l) format output.  This option is incompatible
		 with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,
		 Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the
		 number of digits to four or fewer using base 2 for sizes.	This
		 option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

	 -i      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode
	     number).

     -k      This has the same effect as setting environment variable
	     BLOCKSIZE to 1024, except that it also nullifies any -h options
	     to its left.

     -l      (The lowercase letter “ell”.) List files in the long format, as
	     described in the The Long Format subsection below.

     -m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by
	     commas.

     -n      Display user and group IDs numerically rather than converting to
	     a user or group name in a long (-l) output.  This option turns on
	     the -l option.

     -o      List in long format, but omit the group id.

     -p      Write a slash (‘/’) after each filename if that file is a
	     directory.

     -q      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the
	     character ‘?’; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -r      Reverse the order of the sort.

     -s      Display the number of blocks used in the file system by each
	     file.  Block sizes and directory totals are handled as described
	     in The Long Format subsection below, except (if the long format
	     is not also requested) the directory totals are not output when
	     the output is in a single column, even if multi-column output is
	     requested.  (-l) format, display complete time information for
	     the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.
	     The -D option gives even more control over the output format.
	     This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -t      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).
	     If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their
	     names in ascending lexicographical order.	The -r option reverses
	     both of these sort orders.

	     Note that these sort orders are contradictory: the time sequence
	     is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in ascending
	     order.  This behavior is mandated by IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).
	     This feature can cause problems listing files stored with
	     sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital
	     cameras, where it is possible to have more than one image with
	     the same timestamp.  In such a case, the photos cannot be listed
	     in the sequence in which they were taken.	To ensure the same
	     sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the
	     environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -y option.  This
	     causes ls to reverse the lexicographical sort order when sorting
	     files with the same modification timestamp.

     -u      Use time of last access, instead of time of last modification of
	     the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).

     -v      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the
	     default when output is not to a terminal.

     -w      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the
	     default when output is not to a terminal.	This option is not
	     defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

     -x      The same as -C, except that the multi-column output is produced
	     with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.

     -y      When the -t option is set, sort the alphabetical output in the
	     same order as the time output.  This has the same effect as
	     setting LS_SAMESORT.  See the description of the -t option for
	     more details.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
	     (“POSIX.1”).

	 -%      Distinguish dataless files and directories with a '%' character
		 in long (-l) output, and don't materialize dataless directories
		 when listing them.

	 -1      (The numeric digit “one”.) Force output to be one entry per line.
		 This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

	 -,      (Comma) When the -l option is set, print file sizes grouped and
		 separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator returned
		 by localeconv(3), typically a comma or period.  If no locale is
		 set, or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator, this
		 option has no effect.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std
		 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

	 The -1, -C, -x, and -l options all override each other; the last one
	 specified determines the format used.

	 The -c, -u, and -U options all override each other; the last one
	 specified determines the file time used.

	 The -S and -t options override each other; the last one specified
	 determines the sort order used.

	 The -B, -b, -w, and -q options all override each other; the last one
	 specified determines the format used for non-printable characters.

	 The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or
	 fully); they are applied in the order specified.

	 By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the
	 exceptions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are specified.

	 File information is displayed with one or more ⟨blank⟩s separating the
	 information associated with the -i, -s, and -l options.

   The Long Format
	 If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for
	 each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of
	 bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last
	 modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the
	 pathname.	If the file or directory has extended attributes, the
	 permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@'
	 character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security
	 information (such as an access control list), the permissions field
	 printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -%
	 option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for
	 dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+'
	 character.

	 If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or
	 future, and the -D or -T are not specified, then the year of the last
	 modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.

	 If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n
	 option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the device
     number for the file is displayed in the size field.  If the file is a
     symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by “->”.

	 The listing of a directory's contents is preceded by a labeled total
	 number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as
	 the directory's contents (which may or may not include . and .. and other
     files which start with a dot, depending on other options).

     The default block size is 512 bytes.  The block size may be set with
     option -k or environment variable BLOCKSIZE.  Numbers of blocks in the
     output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as
     many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which might have a
     different size).

     The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type and
     the permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as
     follows:

	   -	 Regular file.
	   b	 Block special file.
	   c	 Character special file.
	   d	 Directory.
	   l	 Symbolic link.
	   p	 FIFO.
	   s	 Socket.
	   w	 Whiteout.

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group
     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character
     positions:

	   1.	If r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable.

	   2.	If w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable.

	   3.	The first of the following that applies:

		      S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not
			    executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
			    group permissions, the file is not executable and
			    set-group-ID mode is set.

		      s     If in the owner permissions, the file is
			    executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
			    group permissions, the file is executable and
			    setgroup-ID mode is set.

		      x     The file is executable or the directory is
			    searchable.

		      -     The file is neither readable, writable,
			    executable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode,
			    nor sticky.  (See below.)

		These next two apply only to the third character in the last
		group (other permissions).

		      T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute
			    or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or
			    sticky(7).)

		      t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is
			    searchable or executable.  (See chmod(1) or
			    sticky(7).)

     The next field contains a plus (‘+’) character if the file has an ACL, or
     a space (‘ ’) if it does not.  The ls utility does not show the actual
     ACL unless the -e option is used in conjunction with the -l option.



### cat

## NAME

     cat – concatenate and print files


## SYNOPSIS

     cat [-belnstuv] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output.  The file operands are processed in command-line order.  If file
     is a single dash (‘-’) or absent, cat reads from the standard input.  If
     file is a UNIX domain socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until
     EOF.  This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in
     inetd(8).

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display
	     a dollar sign (‘$’) at the end of each line.

     -l      Set an exclusive advisory lock on the standard output file
	     descriptor.  This lock is set using fcntl(2) with the F_SETLKW
	     command.  If the output file is already locked, cat will block
	     until the lock is acquired.

     -n      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

     -s      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
	     single spaced.

     -t      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display
	     tab characters as ‘^I’.

     -u      Disable output buffering.

     -v      Display non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control
	     characters print as ‘^X’ for control-X; the delete character
	     (octal 0177) prints as ‘^?’.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high
	     bit set) are printed as ‘M-’ (for meta) followed by the character
	     for the low 7 bits.



### cp

## NAME

     cp – copy files


## SYNOPSIS

     cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNpSsvXx]
	source_file target_file
     cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNpSsvXx]
	source_file ... target_directory
     cp [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNPpSsvXx] source_file target_file
     cp [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNPpSsvXx] source_file ... target_directory


## DESCRIPTION

     In the first synopsis form, the cp utility copies the contents of the
     source_file to the target_file.  In the second synopsis form, the
     contents of each named source_file is copied to the destination
     target_directory.	The names of the files themselves are not changed.  If
     cp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

     The following options are available:

     -H    If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
	   are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
	   are not followed.)

     -L    If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     -P    No symbolic links are followed.  This is the default if the -R
	   option is specified.

     -R    If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory and
	   the entire subtree connected at that point.	If the source_file
	   ends in a /, the contents of the directory are copied rather than
	   the directory itself.  This option also causes symbolic links to be
	   copied, rather than indirected through, and for cp to create
	   special files rather than copying them as normal files.  Created
	   directories have the same mode as the corresponding source
	   directory, unmodified by the process' umask.

	   In -R mode, cp will continue copying even if errors are detected.

	   Note that cp copies hard linked files as separate files.  If you
	   need to preserve hard links, consider using tar(1), cpio(1), or
	   pax(1) instead.

	 -a    Archive mode.  Same as -RpP.  Preserves structure and attributes of
	   files but not directory structure.

	 -c    copy files using clonefile(2).  Note that if clonefile(2) is not
	   supported for the target filesystem, then cp will fallback to using
	   copyfile(2) instead to ensure the copy still succeeds.

	 -f    For each existing destination pathname, remove it and create a new
	   file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its
	   permissions.  (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n
	   options.)

	   The target file is not unlinked before the copy.  Thus, any
	   existing access rights will be retained.

	 -i    Cause cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before
	   copying a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the
	   response from the standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or
	   ‘Y’, the file copy is attempted.  (The -i option overrides any
	   previous -f or -n options.)

	 -l    Create hard links to regular files in a hierarchy instead of
	   copying.

	 -N    When used with -p, suppress copying file flags.

	 -n    Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any
	   previous -f or -i options.)

	 -p    Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source file
	   in the copy: modification time, access time, file flags, file mode,
	   user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.  Access Control
	   Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource
	   forks, will also be preserved.

	   If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message
	   is displayed and the exit value is not altered.

	   If the source file has its set-user-ID bit on and the user ID
	   cannot be preserved, the set-user-ID bit is not preserved in the
	   copy's permissions.	If the source file has its set-group-ID bit on
	   and the group ID cannot be preserved, the set-group-ID bit is not
	   preserved in the copy's permissions.  If the source file has both
	   its set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on, and either the user ID or
	   group ID cannot be preserved, neither the set-user-ID nor set-
	   group-ID bits are preserved in the copy's permissions.

     -S    Do not attempt to preserve holes in sparse files.

     -s    Create symbolic links to regular files in a hierarchy instead of
	   copying.

     -v    Cause cp to be verbose, showing files as they are copied.

     -X    Do not copy Extended Attributes (EAs) or resource forks.

     -x    File system mount points are not traversed.

     For each destination file that already exists, its contents are
     overwritten if permissions allow.	Its mode, user ID, and group ID are
     unchanged unless the -p option was specified.

     In the second synopsis form, target_directory must exist unless there is
     only one named source_file which is a directory and the -R flag is
     specified.

     If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source file is
     used as modified by the file mode creation mask (umask, see csh(1)).  If
     the source file has its set-user-ID bit on, that bit is removed unless
     both the source file and the destination file are owned by the same user.
     If the source file has its set-group-ID bit on, that bit is removed
     unless both the source file and the destination file are in the same
     group and the user is a member of that group.  If both the set-user-ID
     and set-group-ID bits are set, all of the above conditions must be
     fulfilled or both bits are removed.

     Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.

     Symbolic links are always followed unless the -R flag is set, in which
     case symbolic links are not followed, by default.	The -H or -L flags (in
     conjunction with the -R flag) cause symbolic links to be followed as
     described above.  The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R
     option is specified.  In addition, these options override each other and
	 the command's actions are determined by the last one specified.

	 If cp receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal,
	 the current input and output file and the percentage complete will be
	 written to the standard output.

	 If cp encounters an I/O error during the copy, then cp may leave a
	 partially copied target_file in place.  cp specifically avoids cleaning
	 up the output file in error cases to avoid further data loss in cases
	 where the source may not be recoverable.  Alternatives, like install(1),
	 may be preferred if stronger guarantees about the target_file are
	 required.



### mv

## NAME

	 mv – move files


## SYNOPSIS

	 mv [-f | -i | -n] [-hv] source target
	 mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory


## DESCRIPTION

	 In its first form, the mv utility renames the file named by the source
	 operand to the destination path named by the target operand.  This form
	 is assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing
	 directory.

	 In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a
	 destination file in the existing directory named by the directory
	 operand.  The destination path for each operand is the pathname produced
	 by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname
	 component of the named file.

	 The following options are available:

	 -f      Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination
		 path.  (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n options.)

	 -h      If the target operand is a symbolic link to a directory, do not
		 follow it.  This causes the mv utility to rename the file source
		 to the destination path target rather than moving source into the
		 directory referenced by target.

	 -i      Cause mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file
		 that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the
		 standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the move is
		 attempted.  (The -i option overrides any previous -f or -n
		 options.)

	 -n      Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any
		 previous -f or -i options.)

	 -v      Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.

	 It is an error for the source operand to specify a directory if the
	 target exists and is not a directory.

	 If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mv
	 prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the -i option.

	 As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mv uses cp(1)
	 and rm(1) to accomplish the move.	The effect is equivalent to:

	   rm -f destination_path && \
	   cp -pRP source_file destination && \
	   rm -rf source_file



### rm

## NAME

	 rm, unlink – remove directory entries


## SYNOPSIS

	 rm [-f | -i] [-dIRrvWx] file ...
	 unlink [--] file


## DESCRIPTION

	 The rm utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified
	 on the command line.  If the permissions of the file do not permit
	 writing, and the standard input device is a terminal, the user is
	 prompted (on the standard error output) for confirmation.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -d      Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.

	 -f      Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
		 regardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does not
	     exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the exit
	     status to reflect an error.  The -f option overrides any previous
	     -i options.

     -i      Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file,
		 regardless of the file's permissions, or whether or not the
		 standard input device is a terminal.  The -i option overrides any
		 previous -f options.

	 -I      Request confirmation once if more than three files are being
		 removed or if a directory is being recursively removed.  This is
		 a far less intrusive option than -i yet provides almost the same
		 level of protection against mistakes.

	 -P      This flag has no effect.  It is kept only for backwards
		 compatibility with 4.4BSD-Lite2.

	 -R      Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file
		 argument.	The -R option implies the -d option.  If the -i option
		 is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before each
		 directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt
	     is made to remove the directory).	If the user does not respond
	     affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in that directory is
	     skipped.

     -r      Equivalent to -R.

     -v      Be verbose when deleting files, showing them as they are removed.

     -W      Attempt to undelete the named files.  Currently, this option can
	     only be used to recover files covered by whiteouts in a union
	     file system (see undelete(2)).

     -x      When removing a hierarchy, do not cross mount points.

     The rm utility removes symbolic links, not the files referenced by the
     links.

     It is an error to attempt to remove the files /, . or ...

     When the utility is called as unlink, only one argument, which must not
     be a directory, may be supplied.  No options may be supplied in this
     simple mode of operation, which performs an unlink(2) operation on the
     passed argument.  However, the usual option-end delimiter, --, may
     optionally precede the argument.



### mkdir

## NAME

     mkdir – make directories


## SYNOPSIS

     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...


## DESCRIPTION

     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order
     specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the current
     umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode	    Set the file permission bits of the final created
		    directory to the specified mode.  The mode argument can be
		    in any of the formats specified to the chmod(1) command.
		    If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters
		    ‘+’ and ‘-’ are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
		    “a=rwx”.

     -p 	    Create intermediate directories as required.  If this
		    option is not specified, the full path prefix of each
		    operand must already exist.  On the other hand, with this
		    option specified, no error will be reported if a directory
		    given as an operand already exists.  Intermediate
		    directories are created with permission bits of
		    “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus
		    write and search permission for the owner.

     -v 	    Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they
		    are created.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.



### rmdir

## NAME

     rmdir – remove directories


## SYNOPSIS

     rmdir [-pv] directory ...


## DESCRIPTION

     The rmdir utility removes the directory entry specified by each directory
     argument, provided it is empty.

     Arguments are processed in the order given.  In order to remove both a
     parent directory and a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must
     be specified first so the parent directory is empty when rmdir tries to
     remove it.

     The following option is available:

     -p      Each directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all
	     components will be removed, if they are empty, starting with the
	     last most component.  (See rm(1) for fully non-discriminant
	     recursive removal.)

     -v      Be verbose, listing each directory as it is removed.



### touch

## NAME

     touch – change file access and modification times


## SYNOPSIS

     touch [-A [-][[hh]mm]SS] [-achm] [-r file] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]
	   [-d YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]] file ...


## DESCRIPTION

     The touch utility sets the modification and access times of files.  If
     any file does not exist, it is created with default permissions.

     By default, touch changes both modification and access times.  The -a and
     -m flags may be used to select the access time or the modification time
     individually.  Selecting both is equivalent to the default.  By default,
     the timestamps are set to the current time.  The -d and -t flags
     explicitly specify a different time, and the -r flag specifies to set the
     times those of the specified file.  The -A flag adjusts the values by a
     specified amount.

     The following options are available:

     -A      Adjust the access and modification time stamps for the file by
	     the specified value.  This flag is intended for use in modifying
	     files with incorrectly set time stamps.

	     The argument is of the form “[-][[hh]mm]SS” where each pair of
	     letters represents the following:

		   -	   Make the adjustment negative: the new time stamp is
			   set to be before the old one.
		   hh	   The number of hours, from 00 to 99.
		   mm	   The number of minutes, from 00 to 59.
		   SS	   The number of seconds, from 00 to 59.

	     The -A flag implies the -c flag: if any file specified does not
	     exist, it will be silently ignored.

     -a      Change the access time of the file.  The modification time of the
	     file is not changed unless the -m flag is also specified.

     -c      Do not create the file if it does not exist.  The touch utility
	     does not treat this as an error.  No error messages are displayed
	     and the exit value is not affected.

     -d      Change the access and modification times to the specified date
	     time instead of the current time of day.  The argument is of the
	     form “YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]” where the letters represent
	     the following:
		   YYYY    At least four decimal digits representing the year.
		   MM, DD, hh, mm, SS
			   As with -t time.
		   T	   The letter T or a space is the time designator.
		   .frac   An optional fraction, consisting of a period or a
			   comma followed by one or more digits.  The number
			   of significant digits depends on the kernel
			   configuration and the filesystem, and may be zero.
		   tz	   An optional letter Z indicating the time is in UTC.
			   Otherwise, the time is assumed to be in local time.
			   Local time is affected by the value of the TZ
			   environment variable.

     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the times of the link
	     itself rather than the file that the link points to.  Note that
	     -h implies -c and thus will not create any new files.

     -m      Change the modification time of the file.	The access time of the
	     file is not changed unless the -a flag is also specified.

     -r      Use the access and modifications times from the specified file
	     instead of the current time of day.

     -t      Change the access and modification times to the specified time
	     instead of the current time of day.  The argument is of the form
	     “[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]” where each pair of letters represents the
	     following:

		   CC	   The first two digits of the year (the century).
		   YY	   The second two digits of the year.  If “YY” is
			   specified, but “CC” is not, a value for “YY”
			   between 69 and 99 results in a “CC” value of 19.
			   Otherwise, a “CC” value of 20 is used.
		   MM	   The month of the year, from 01 to 12.
		   DD	   the day of the month, from 01 to 31.
		   hh	   The hour of the day, from 00 to 23.
		   mm	   The minute of the hour, from 00 to 59.
		   SS	   The second of the minute, from 00 to 60.

	     If the “CC” and “YY” letter pairs are not specified, the values
	     default to the current year.  If the “SS” letter pair is not
	     specified, the value defaults to 0.



### pwd

## NAME

     pwd – return working directory name


## SYNOPSIS

     pwd [-L | -P]


## DESCRIPTION

     The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working
     directory to the standard output.

     Some shells may provide a builtin pwd command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     The options are as follows:

     -L      Display the logical current working directory.

     -P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
	     links resolved).

     If no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.

     unalias, uncomplete, unhash, unlimit, unset, unsetenv, until, wait,
     where, which, while – shell built-in commands


## SYNOPSIS

     See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual
     page.


## DESCRIPTION

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the
	 running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin
	 commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any
	 component of a pipeline except the last.

	 If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ‘/’, the shell will
	 not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
	 specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
	 specifying “echo” causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
	 that support the echo builtin command, specifying “/bin/echo” or “./echo”
	 does not.

	 While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their
	 operation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below
	 is a table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that
	 support them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

	 Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
	 Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.	Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands “built-in commands” and some of them “reserved words”.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked “No**” under External do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

### file

## NAME

     file – determine file type


## SYNOPSIS

     file [-bcdDhiIkLnNprsvz] [--exclude-quiet] [--extension]
	  [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles]
	  [-P name=value] [-M magicfiles] file
     file -C [-m magicfiles]
     file [--help]


## DESCRIPTION

     This manual page documents version 5.41 of the file command.

     file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three
     sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests,
     and language tests.  The first test that succeeds causes the file type to
     be printed.

     The type printed will usually contain one of the words text (the file
     contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and
     is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), executable (the file
     contains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to
     some UNIX kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is
     usually “binary” or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file
     formats (core files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.
     When modifying magic files or the program itself, make sure to preserve
     these keywords.  Users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a
	 directory have the word “text” printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and
	 change “shell commands text” to “shell script”.

	 The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2)
	 system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's
     some sort of special file.  Any known file types appropriate to the
     system you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes
     (FIFOs) on those systems that implement them) are intuited if they are
     defined in the system header file <sys/stat.h>.

     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed
     formats.  The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled
     program) a.out file, whose format is defined in <elf.h>, <a.out.h> and
     possibly <exec.h> in the standard include directory.  These files have a
     “magic number” stored in a particular place near the beginning of the
     file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary
     executable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a “magic
     number” has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some
     invariant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be
     described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read
     from the compiled magic file /usr/share/file/magic.mgc, or the files in
     the directory /usr/share/file/magic if the compiled file does not exist.

     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is
     examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-
     ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used on Macintosh
     and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and
     EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and
     sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If a file
     passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.	ASCII,
     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as “text”
     because they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
     EBCDIC are only “character data” because, while they contain text, it is
     text that will require translation before it can be read.	In addition,
     file will attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type files.
     If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the
     Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain embedded
     escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.

     Once file has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it
     will attempt to determine in what language the file is written.  The
     language tests look for particular strings (cf.  <names.h>) that can
     appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the
     keyword .br indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input file,
     just as the keyword struct indicates a C program.	These tests are less
     reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The
     language test routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1)
     archives, JSON files).

     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the
     character sets listed above is simply said to be “data”.



### stat

## NAME

     stat, readlink – display file status


## SYNOPSIS

     stat [-FLnq] [-f format | -l | -r | -s | -x] [-t timefmt] [file ...]
     readlink [-fn] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The stat utility displays information about the file pointed to by file.
     Read, write, or execute permissions of the named file are not required,
     but all directories listed in the pathname leading to the file must be
     searchable.  If no argument is given, stat displays information about the
     file descriptor for standard input.

     When invoked as readlink, only the target of the symbolic link is
     printed.  If the given argument is not a symbolic link and the -f option
     is not specified, readlink will print nothing and exit with an error.  If
     the -f option is specified, the output is canonicalized by following
     every symlink in every component of the given path recursively.  readlink
     will resolve both absolute and relative paths, and return the absolute
     pathname corresponding to file.  In this case, the argument does not need
     to be a symbolic link.

     The information displayed is obtained by calling lstat(2) with the given
     argument and evaluating the returned structure.  The default format
     displays the st_dev, st_ino, st_mode, st_nlink, st_uid, st_gid, st_rdev,
     st_size, st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime, st_birthtime, st_blksize,
     st_blocks, and st_flags fields, in that order.

     The options are as follows:

     -F      As in ls(1), display a slash (‘/’) immediately after each
	     pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (‘*’) after each that
	     is executable, an at sign (‘@’) after each symbolic link, a
	     percent sign (‘%’) after each whiteout, an equal sign (‘=’) after
	     each socket, and a vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.
	     The use of -F implies -l.

     -L      Use stat(2) instead of lstat(2).  The information reported by
	     stat will refer to the target of file, if file is a symbolic
	     link, and not to file itself.  If the link is broken or the
	     target does not exist, fall back on lstat(2) and report
	     information about the link.

     -f format
	     Display information using the specified format.  See the Formats
	     section for a description of valid formats.

     -l      Display output in ls -lT format.

     -n      Do not force a newline to appear at the end of each piece of
	     output.

     -q      Suppress failure messages if calls to stat(2) or lstat(2) fail.
	     When run as readlink, error messages are automatically
	     suppressed.

     -r      Display raw information.  That is, for all the fields in the stat
	     structure, display the raw, numerical value (for example, times
	     in seconds since the epoch, etc.).

     -s      Display information in “shell output” format, suitable for
	     initializing variables.

     -t timefmt
	     Display timestamps using the specified format.  This format is
	     passed directly to strftime(3).

     -x      Display information in a more verbose way as known from some
	     Linux distributions.

   Formats
     Format strings are similar to printf(3) formats in that they start with
     %, are then followed by a sequence of formatting characters, and end in a
     character that selects the field of the struct stat which is to be
     formatted.  If the % is immediately followed by one of n, t, %, or @,
     then a newline character, a tab character, a percent character, or the
     current file number is printed, otherwise the string is examined for the
     following:

     Any of the following optional flags:

     #	     Selects an alternate output form for octal and hexadecimal
	     output.  Non-zero octal output will have a leading zero, and non-
	     zero hexadecimal output will have “0x” prepended to it.

     +	     Asserts that a sign indicating whether a number is positive or
	     negative should always be printed.  Non-negative numbers are not
	     usually printed with a sign.

     -	     Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the
	     right.

     0	     Sets the fill character for left padding to the ‘0’ character,
	     instead of a space.

     space   Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output
	     fields.  A ‘+’ overrides a space if both are used.

     Then the following fields:

     size    An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field
	     width.

     prec    An optional precision composed of a decimal point ‘.’ and a
	     decimal digit string that indicates the maximum string length,
	     the number of digits to appear after the decimal point in
	     floating point output, or the minimum number of digits to appear
	     in numeric output.

     fmt     An optional output format specifier which is one of D, O, U, X,
	     F, or S.  These represent signed decimal output, octal output,
	     unsigned decimal output, hexadecimal output, floating point
	     output, and string output, respectively.  Some output formats do
	     not apply to all fields.  Floating point output only applies to
	     timespec fields (the a, m, and c fields).

	     The special output specifier S may be used to indicate that the
	     output, if applicable, should be in string format.  May be used
	     in combination with:

	     amc     Display date in strftime(3) format.

	     dr      Display actual device name.

	     f	     Display the flags of file as in ls -lTdo.

	     gu      Display group or user name.

	     p	     Display the mode of file as in ls -lTd.

	     N	     Displays the name of file.

	     T	     Displays the type of file.

	     Y	     Insert a “ -> ” into the output.  Note that the default
		     output format for Y is a string, but if specified
		     explicitly, these four characters are prepended.

     sub     An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, low).  Only
	     applies to the p, d, r, and T output formats.  It can be one of
	     the following:

	     H	     “High” — specifies the major number for devices from r or
		     d, the “user” bits for permissions from the string form
		     of p, the file “type” bits from the numeric forms of p,
		     and the long output form of T.

	     L	     “Low” — specifies the minor number for devices from r or
		     d, the “other” bits for permissions from the string form
		     of p, the “user”, “group”, and “other” bits from the
		     numeric forms of p, and the ls -F style output character
		     for file type when used with T (the use of L for this is
		     optional).

	     M	     “Middle” — specifies the “group” bits for permissions
		     from the string output form of p, or the “suid”, “sgid”,
		     and “sticky” bits for the numeric forms of p.

     datum   A required field specifier, being one of the following:

	     d	     Device upon which file resides (st_dev).

		 i	     file's inode number (st_ino).

		 p	     File type and permissions (st_mode).

		 l	     Number of hard links to file (st_nlink).

		 u, g    User ID and group ID of file's owner (st_uid, st_gid).

	     r	     Device number for character and block device special
		     files (st_rdev).

	     a, m, c, B
		     The time file was last accessed or modified, or when the
		     inode was last changed, or the birth time of the inode
		     (st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime, st_birthtime).

	     z	     The size of file in bytes (st_size).

	     b	     Number of blocks allocated for file (st_blocks).

	     k	     Optimal file system I/O operation block size
		     (st_blksize).

	     f	     User defined flags for file.

	     v	     Inode generation number (st_gen).

	     The following five field specifiers are not drawn directly from
	     the data in struct stat, but are:

	     N	     The name of the file.

	     R	     The absolute pathname corresponding to the file.

	     T	     The file type, either as in ls -F or in a more
		     descriptive form if the sub field specifier H is given.

	     Y	     The target of a symbolic link.

	     Z	     Expands to “major,minor” from the rdev field for
		     character or block special devices and gives size output
		     for all others.

     Only the % and the field specifier are required.  Most field specifiers
     default to U as an output form, with the exception of p which defaults to
     O; a, m, and c which default to D; and Y, T, and N which default to S.



### chmod

## NAME

     chmod – change file modes or Access Control Lists


## SYNOPSIS

     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] mode file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a] ACE file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E] file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-C] file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-N] file ...


## DESCRIPTION

     The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as
     specified by the mode operand. It may also be used to modify the Access
     Control Lists (ACLs) associated with the listed files.

     The generic options are as follows:

     -f      Do not display a diagnostic message if chmod could not modify the
	     mode for file, nor modify the exit status to reflect such
	     failures.

     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
	     are followed and hence unaffected by the command.	(Symbolic
	     links encountered during tree traversal are not followed.)

     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the mode of the link
	     itself rather than the file that the link points to.

     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
	     This is the default.

     -R      Change the modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the files,
	     instead of just the files themselves.  Beware of unintentionally
	     matching the “..” hard link to the parent directory when using
	     wildcards like “.*”.

     -v      Cause chmod to be verbose, showing filenames as the mode is
	     modified.	If the -v flag is specified more than once, the old
	     and new modes of the file will also be printed, in both octal and
	     symbolic notation.

     The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.
	 In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
	 are determined by the last one specified.

	 If chmod receives a SIGINFO signal (see the status argument for stty(1)),
	 then the current filename as well as the old and new modes are displayed.

	 Only the owner of a file or the super-user is permitted to change the
	 mode of a file.



### chown

## NAME

	 chown – change file owner and group


## SYNOPSIS

	 chown [-fhnvx] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] owner[:group] file ...
	 chown [-fhnvx] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] :group file ...


## DESCRIPTION

	 The chown utility changes the user ID and/or the group ID of the
	 specified files.  Symbolic links named by arguments are silently left
	 unchanged unless -h is used.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
		 are followed and hence unaffected by the command.	(Symbolic
		 links encountered during traversal are not followed.)

	 -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

	 -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
		 Instead, the user and/or group ID of the link itself are
		 modified.	This is the default.  For matching behavior when using
		 chown without the -R option, the -h option should be used
		 instead.

	 -R      Change the user ID and/or the group ID of the file hierarchies
		 rooted in the files, instead of just the files themselves.
		 Beware of unintentionally matching the “..” hard link to the
		 parent directory when using wildcards like “.*”.

	 -f      Do not report any failure to change file owner or group, nor
		 modify the exit status to reflect such failures.

	 -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the user ID and/or the
		 group ID of the link itself.

	 -n      Interpret user ID and group ID as numeric, avoiding name lookups.

	 -v      Cause chown to be verbose, showing files as the owner is
		 modified.	If the -v flag is specified more than once, chown will
		 print the filename, followed by the old and new numeric
		 user/group ID.

	 -x      File system mount points are not traversed.

	 The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.
	 In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
     are determined by the last one specified.

     The owner and group operands are both optional, however, one must be
     specified.  If the group operand is specified, it must be preceded by a
	 colon (``:'') character.

     The owner may be either a numeric user ID or a user name.	If a user name
     is also a numeric user ID, the operand is used as a user name.  The group
     may be either a numeric group ID or a group name.	If a group name is
     also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a group name.

     The ownership of a file may only be altered by a super-user for obvious
     security reasons.	Similarly, only a member of a group can change a
	 file's group ID to that group.

	 If chown receives a SIGINFO signal (see the status argument for stty(1)),
	 then the current filename as well as the old and new file owner and group
	 are displayed.



### chgrp

## NAME

	 chgrp – change group


## SYNOPSIS

	 chgrp [-fhnvx] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] group file ...


## DESCRIPTION

	 The chgrp utility sets the group ID of the file named by each file
	 operand to the group ID specified by the group operand.

	 The following options are available:

	 -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
		 are followed and hence unaffected by the command.	(Symbolic
		 links encountered during traversal are not followed.)

	 -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

	 -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
		 This is the default.  Use -h to change the group ID of a symbolic
		 link.

	 -R      Change the group ID of the file hierarchies rooted in the files,
		 instead of just the files themselves.  Beware of unintentionally
		 matching the “..” hard link to the parent directory when using
		 wildcards like “.*”.

	 -f      The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and does
		 not query about strange modes (unless the user does not have
		 proper permissions).

	 -h      If the file is a symbolic link, the group ID of the link itself
		 is changed rather than the file that is pointed to.

	 -n      Interpret the group ID as numeric, avoiding the name lookup.

	 -v      Cause chgrp to be verbose, showing files as the group is
		 modified.	If the -v flag is specified more than once, chgrp will
		 print the filename, followed by the old and new numeric group ID.

	 -x      File system mount points are not traversed.

	 The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.
	 In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
     are determined by the last one specified.

     The group operand can be either a group name from the group database, or
     a numeric group ID.  If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the
     operand is used as a group name.

     The user invoking chgrp must belong to the specified group and be the
     owner of the file, or be the super-user.

     If chgrp receives a SIGINFO signal (see the status argument for stty(1)),
     then the current filename as well as the old and new group names are
     displayed.

     unalias, uncomplete, unhash, unlimit, unset, unsetenv, until, wait,
     where, which, while – shell built-in commands


## SYNOPSIS

     See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual
     page.


## DESCRIPTION

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the
	 running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin
	 commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any
	 component of a pipeline except the last.

	 If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ‘/’, the shell will
	 not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
	 specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
	 specifying “echo” causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
	 that support the echo builtin command, specifying “/bin/echo” or “./echo”
	 does not.

	 While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their
	 operation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below
	 is a table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that
	 support them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

	 Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
	 Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.	Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands “built-in commands” and some of them “reserved words”.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked “No**” under External do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

### find

## NAME

     find – walk a file hierarchy


## SYNOPSIS

     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...] [expression]


## DESCRIPTION

     The find utility recursively descends the directory tree for each path
     listed, evaluating an expression (composed of the “primaries” and
     “operands” listed below) in terms of each file in the tree.

     The options are as follows:

     -E      Interpret regular expressions following the -regex and -iregex
	     primaries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than
		 basic regular expressions (BRE's).  The re_format(7) manual page
		 fully describes both formats.

	 -H      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
		 for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be those
		 of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the
		 referenced file does not exist, the file information and type
		 will be for the link itself.  File information of all symbolic
		 links not on the command line is that of the link itself.

	 -L      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
		 for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the
		 link, not the link itself.  If the referenced file does not
		 exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

		 This option is equivalent to the deprecated -follow primary.

	 -P      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
		 for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself.  This is
		 the default.

	 -X      Permit find to be safely used in conjunction with xargs(1).  If a
		 file name contains any of the delimiting characters used by
		 xargs(1), a diagnostic message is displayed on standard error,
		 and the file is skipped.  The delimiting characters include
		 single (“ ' ”) and double (“ " ”) quotes, backslash (“\”), space,
	     tab and newline characters.

	     However, you may wish to consider the -print0 primary in
	     conjunction with “xargs -0” as an effective alternative.

     -d      Cause find to perform a depth-first traversal.

	     This option is a BSD-specific equivalent of the -depth primary
	     specified by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).  Refer to its
	     description under PRIMARIES for more information.

     -f path
	     Add path to the list of paths that will be recursed into.	This
	     is useful when path begins with a character that would otherwise
	     be interpreted as an expression, namely “!” , “(” and “-”.

     -s      Cause find to traverse the file hierarchies in lexicographical
	     order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory.  Note:
	     ‘find -s’ and ‘find | sort’ may give different results.

	     For example, ‘find -s’ puts a directory ‘foo’ with all its
	     contents before a directory ‘foo’.  but ‘find | sort’ puts the
	     directory name ‘foo’.  before any string like ‘foo/bar’ because
	     ‘.’ goes before ‘/’ in ASCII.  In locales other than C results
	     may vary more due to collation differences.

     -x      Prevent find from descending into directories that have a device
	     number different than that of the file from which the descent
	     began.

	     This option is equivalent to the deprecated -xdev primary.



### locate

## NAME

     locate – find filenames quickly


## SYNOPSIS

     locate [-0Scims] [-l limit] [-d database] pattern ...


## DESCRIPTION

     The locate program searches a database for all pathnames which match the
     specified pattern.  The database is recomputed periodically (usually
     weekly or daily), and contains the pathnames of all files which are
     publicly accessible.

     Shell globbing and quoting characters (“*”, “?”, “\”, “[” and “]”) may be
     used in pattern, although they will have to be escaped from the shell.
     Preceding any character with a backslash (“\”) eliminates any special
     meaning which it may have.  The matching differs in that no characters
     must be matched explicitly, including slashes (“/”).

     As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (“foo”) is
     matched as though it were “*foo*”.

     Historically, locate only stored characters between 32 and 127.  The
     current implementation stores any character except newline (‘\n’) and NUL
     (‘\0’).  The 8-bit character support does not waste extra space for plain
     ASCII file names.	Characters less than 32 or greater than 127 are stored
     in 2 bytes.

     The following options are available:

     -0 	 Print pathnames separated by an ASCII NUL character
		 (character code 0) instead of default NL (newline, character
		 code 10).

     -S 	 Print some statistics about the database and exit.

     -c 	 Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
		 file names.

     -d database
		 Search in database instead of the default file name database.
		 Multiple -d options are allowed.  Each additional -d option
		 adds the specified database to the list of databases to be
		 searched.

		 The option database may be a colon-separated list of
		 databases.  A single colon is a reference to the default
		 database.

		 $ locate -d $HOME/lib/mydb: foo

		 will first search string “foo” in $HOME/lib/mydb and then in
		 /var/db/locate.database.

		 $ locate -d $HOME/lib/mydb::/cdrom/locate.database foo

		 will first search string “foo” in $HOME/lib/mydb and then in
		 /var/db/locate.database and then in /cdrom/locate.database.

		       $ locate -d db1 -d db2 -d db3 pattern

		 is the same as

		       $ locate -d db1:db2:db3 pattern

		 or

		       $ locate -d db1:db2 -d db3 pattern

		 If - is given as the database name, standard input will be
		 read instead.	For example, you can compress your database
		 and use:

		 $ zcat database.gz | locate -d - pattern

		 This might be useful on machines with a fast CPU and little
		 RAM and slow I/O.  Note: you can only use one pattern for
		 stdin.

     -i 	 Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the
		 database.

     -l number	 Limit output to number of file names and exit.

     -m 	 Use mmap(2) instead of the stdio(3) library.  This is the
		 default behavior and is faster in most cases.

     -s 	 Use the stdio(3) library instead of mmap(2).



### which

## NAME

	 which – locate a program file in the user's path


## SYNOPSIS

	 which [-as] program ...


## DESCRIPTION

	 The which utility takes a list of command names and searches the path for
	 each executable file that would be run had these commands actually been
	 invoked.

	 The following options are available:

	 -a      List all instances of executables found (instead of just the
		 first one of each).

	 -s      No output, just return 0 if all of the executables are found, or
		 1 if some were not found.

	 Some shells may provide a builtin which command which is similar or
	 identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.



### whereis

## NAME

	 whereis – locate programs


## SYNOPSIS

	 whereis [-abmqu] [-BM dir ... -f] program ...


## DESCRIPTION

	 The whereis utility checks the standard binary, and manual page
	 directories for the specified programs, printing out the paths of any it
	 finds.  The supplied program names are first stripped of leading path
	 name components and any single trailing extension added by gzip(1),
	 compress(1), or bzip2(1).

	 The default path searched is the string returned by the sysctl(8) utility
	 for the “user.cs_path” string, with /usr/libexec and the current user's
     $PATH appended.  Manual pages are searched by default along the $MANPATH.

     The following options are available:

     -B      Specify directories to search for binaries.  Requires the -f
	     option.

     -M      Specify directories to search for manual pages.  Requires the -f
	     option.

     -a      Report all matches instead of only the first of each requested
	     type.

     -b      Search for binaries.

     -f      Delimits the list of directories after the -B, -M, or -S options,
	     and indicates the beginning of the program list.

     -m      Search for manual pages.

     -q      (“quiet”).  Suppress the output of the utility name in front of
	     the normal output line.  This can become handy for use in a
	     backquote substitution of a shell command line, see EXAMPLES.

     -u      Search for “unusual” entries.  A file is said to be unusual if it
	     does not have at least one entry of each requested type.  Only
	     the name of the unusual entry is printed.



### grep

## NAME

     grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep, bzgrep, bzegrep, bzfgrep, zgrep, zegrep,
     zfgrep – file pattern searcher


## SYNOPSIS

     grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlMmnOopqRSsUVvwXxZz] [-A num] [-B num] [-C num]
	  [-e pattern] [-f file] [--binary-files=value] [--color[=when]]
	  [--colour[=when]] [--context=num] [--label] [--line-buffered]
	  [--null] [pattern] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that
     match one or more patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line
     if the regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line
     without its trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.
     Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to
     the standard output.

     grep is used for simple patterns and basic regular expressions (BREs);
     egrep can handle extended regular expressions (EREs).  See re_format(7)
     for more information on regular expressions.  fgrep is quicker than both
     grep and egrep, but can only handle fixed patterns (i.e., it does not
     interpret regular expressions).  Patterns may consist of one or more
     lines, allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.

     zgrep, zegrep, and zfgrep act like grep, egrep, and fgrep, respectively,
     but accept input files compressed with the compress(1) or gzip(1)
     compression utilities.  bzgrep, bzegrep, and bzfgrep act like grep,
     egrep, and fgrep, respectively, but accept input files compressed with
     the bzip2(1) compression utility.

     The following options are available:

     -A num, --after-context=num
	     Print num lines of trailing context after each match.  See also
	     the -B and -C options.

     -a, --text
	     Treat all files as ASCII text.  Normally grep will simply print
	     “Binary file ... matches” if files contain binary characters.
	     Use of this option forces grep to output lines matching the
	     specified pattern.

     -B num, --before-context=num
	     Print num lines of leading context before each match.  See also
	     the -A and -C options.

     -b, --byte-offset
	     The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is displayed in front of
	     the respective matched line.

     -C num, --context=num
	     Print num lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each
	     match.  See also the -A and -B options.

     -c, --count
	     Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.

     --colour=[when], --color=[when]
	     Mark up the matching text with the expression stored in the
	     GREP_COLOR environment variable.  The possible values of when are
	     “never”, “always” and “auto”.

     -D action, --devices=action
	     Specify the demanded action for devices, FIFOs and sockets.  The
	     default action is “read”, which means, that they are read as if
	     they were normal files.  If the action is set to “skip”, devices
	     are silently skipped.

     -d action, --directories=action
	     Specify the demanded action for directories.  It is “read” by
	     default, which means that the directories are read in the same
	     manner as normal files.  Other possible values are “skip” to
	     silently ignore the directories, and “recurse” to read them
	     recursively, which has the same effect as the -R and -r option.

     -E, --extended-regexp
	     Interpret pattern as an extended regular expression (i.e., force
	     grep to behave as egrep).

     -e pattern, --regexp=pattern
	     Specify a pattern used during the search of the input: an input
	     line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.
	     This option is most useful when multiple -e options are used to
	     specify multiple patterns, or when a pattern begins with a dash
	     (‘-’).

     --exclude pattern
	     If specified, it excludes files matching the given filename
	     pattern from the search.  Note that --exclude and --include
	     patterns are processed in the order given.  If a name matches
	     multiple patterns, the latest matching rule wins.	If no
	     --include pattern is specified, all files are searched that are
	     not excluded.  Patterns are matched to the full path specified,
	     not only to the filename component.

     --exclude-dir pattern
	     If -R is specified, it excludes directories matching the given
	     filename pattern from the search.	Note that --exclude-dir and
	     --include-dir patterns are processed in the order given.  If a
	     name matches multiple patterns, the latest matching rule wins.
	     If no --include-dir pattern is specified, all directories are
	     searched that are not excluded.

     -F, --fixed-strings
	     Interpret pattern as a set of fixed strings (i.e., force grep to
	     behave as fgrep).

     -f file, --file=file
	     Read one or more newline separated patterns from file.  Empty
	     pattern lines match every input line.  Newlines are not
	     considered part of a pattern.  If file is empty, nothing is
	     matched.

     -G, --basic-regexp
	     Interpret pattern as a basic regular expression (i.e., force grep
	     to behave as traditional grep).

     -H      Always print filename headers with output lines.

     -h, --no-filename
	     Never print filename headers (i.e., filenames) with output lines.

     --help  Print a brief help message.

     -I      Ignore binary files.  This option is equivalent to the
	     “--binary-files=without-match” option.

     -i, --ignore-case
	     Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, grep is case
	     sensitive.

     --include pattern
	     If specified, only files matching the given filename pattern are
	     searched.	Note that --include and --exclude patterns are
	     processed in the order given.  If a name matches multiple
	     patterns, the latest matching rule wins.  Patterns are matched to
	     the full path specified, not only to the filename component.

     --include-dir pattern
	     If -R is specified, only directories matching the given filename
	     pattern are searched.  Note that --include-dir and --exclude-dir
	     patterns are processed in the order given.  If a name matches
	     multiple patterns, the latest matching rule wins.

     -J, --bz2decompress
	     Decompress the bzip2(1) compressed file before looking for the
	     text.

     -L, --files-without-match
	     Only the names of files not containing selected lines are written
	     to standard output.  Pathnames are listed once per file searched.
	     If the standard input is searched, the string “(standard input)”
	     is written unless a --label is specified.

     -l, --files-with-matches
	     Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
	     standard output.  grep will only search a file until a match has
	     been found, making searches potentially less expensive.
	     Pathnames are listed once per file searched.  If the standard
	     input is searched, the string “(standard input)” is written
	     unless a --label is specified.

     --label
	     Label to use in place of “(standard input)” for a file name where
	     a file name would normally be printed.  This option applies to
	     -H, -L, and -l.

     --mmap  Use mmap(2) instead of read(2) to read input, which can result in
	     better performance under some circumstances but can cause
	     undefined behaviour.

     -M, --lzma
	     Decompress the LZMA compressed file before looking for the text.

     -m num, --max-count=num
	     Stop reading the file after num matches.

     -n, --line-number
	     Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the
	     file, starting at line 1.	The line number counter is reset for
	     each file processed.  This option is ignored if -c, -L, -l, or -q
	     is specified.

     --null  Prints a zero-byte after the file name.

     -O      If -R is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were
	     explicitly listed on the command line.  The default is not to
	     follow symbolic links.

     -o, --only-matching
	     Prints only the matching part of the lines.

     -p      If -R is specified, no symbolic links are followed.  This is the
	     default.

     -q, --quiet, --silent
	     Quiet mode: suppress normal output.  grep will only search a file
	     until a match has been found, making searches potentially less
	     expensive.

     -R, -r, --recursive
	     Recursively search subdirectories listed.	(i.e., force grep to
	     behave as rgrep).

     -S      If -R is specified, all symbolic links are followed.  The default
	     is not to follow symbolic links.

     -s, --no-messages
	     Silent mode.  Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored (i.e.,
	     their error messages are suppressed).

     -U, --binary
	     Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.

     -u      This option has no effect and is provided only for compatibility
	     with GNU grep.

     -V, --version
	     Display version information and exit.

     -v, --invert-match
	     Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified
	     patterns.

     -w, --word-regexp
	     The expression is searched for as a word (as if surrounded by
	     ‘[[:<:]]’ and ‘[[:>:]]’; see re_format(7)).  This option has no
	     effect if -x is also specified.

     -x, --line-regexp
	     Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or
	     regular expression are considered to be matching lines.

     -y      Equivalent to -i.	Obsoleted.

     -z, --null-data
	     Treat input and output data as sequences of lines terminated by a
	     zero-byte instead of a newline.

     -X, --xz
	     Decompress the xz(1) compressed file before looking for the text.

     -Z, --decompress
	     Force grep to behave as zgrep.

     --binary-files=value
	     Controls searching and printing of binary files.  Options are:
	     binary (default)  Search binary files but do not print them.
	     without-match     Do not search binary files.
	     text	       Treat all files as text.

     --line-buffered
	     Force output to be line buffered.	By default, output is line
	     buffered when standard output is a terminal and block buffered
	     otherwise.

     If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.
     Additionally, “-” may be used in place of a file name, anywhere that a
     file name is accepted, to read from standard input.  This includes both
     -f and file arguments.



### sed

## NAME

     sed – stream editor


## SYNOPSIS

     sed [-EHalnru] command [-I extension] [-i extension] [file ...]
     sed [-EHalnru] [-e command] [-f command_file] [-I extension]
	 [-i extension] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no
     files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of
     commands.	The input is then written to the standard output.

     A single command may be specified as the first argument to sed.  Multiple
     commands may be specified by using the -e or -f options.  All commands
     are applied to the input in the order they are specified regardless of
     their origin.

     The following options are available:

     -E      Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular
		 expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).  The
		 re_format(7) manual page fully describes both formats.

	 -a      The files listed as parameters for the “w” functions are created
		 (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.  The -a
		 option causes sed to delay opening each file until a command
		 containing the related “w” function is applied to a line of
		 input.

	 -e command
		 Append the editing commands specified by the command argument to
		 the list of commands.

	 -f command_file
		 Append the editing commands found in the file command_file to the
		 list of commands.	The editing commands should each be listed on
		 a separate line.  The commands are read from the standard input
		 if command_file is “-”.

	 -H      Enable enhanced features in the regular expression syntax.  Note
		 that this option is independent of the -E option.	See
		 re_format(7) for details.

	 -I extension
		 Edit files in-place, saving backups with the specified extension.
		 If a zero-length extension is given, no backup will be saved.  It
		 is not recommended to give a zero-length extension when in-place
		 editing files, as you risk corruption or partial content in
		 situations where disk space is exhausted, etc.

		 Note that in-place editing with -I still takes place in a single
		 continuous line address space covering all files, although each
		 file preserves its individuality instead of forming one output
		 stream.  The line counter is never reset between files, address
		 ranges can span file boundaries, and the “$” address matches only
		 the last line of the last file.  (See Sed Addresses.) That can
		 lead to unexpected results in many cases of in-place editing,
		 where using -i is desired.

	 -i extension
		 Edit files in-place similarly to -I, but treat each file
		 independently from other files.  In particular, line numbers in
		 each file start at 1, the “$” address matches the last line of
		 the current file, and address ranges are limited to the current
		 file.  (See Sed Addresses.) The net result is as though each file
		 were edited by a separate sed instance.

	 -l      Make output line buffered.

	 -n      By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output
		 after all of the commands have been applied to it.  The -n option
		 suppresses this behavior.

	 -r      Same as -E for compatibility with GNU sed.

	 -u      Make output unbuffered.

	 The form of a sed command is as follows:

	   [address[,address]]function[arguments]

	 Whitespace may be inserted before the first address and the function
	 portions of the command.

	 Normally, sed cyclically copies a line of input, not including its
	 terminating newline character, into a pattern space, (unless there is
	 something left after a “D” function), applies all of the commands with
	 addresses that select that pattern space, copies the pattern space to the
	 standard output, appending a newline, and deletes the pattern space.

	 Some of the functions use a hold space to save all or part of the pattern
	 space for subsequent retrieval.

Sed Addresses
	 An address is not required, but if specified must have one of the
	 following formats:

	   •   a number that counts input lines cumulatively across input
		   files (or in each file independently if a -i option is in
		   effect);

	   •   a dollar (“$”) character that addresses the last line of input
		   (or the last line of the current file if a -i option was
		   specified);

	   •   a context address that consists of a regular expression
		   preceded and followed by a delimiter.  The closing delimiter
		   can also optionally be followed by the “I” character, to
		   indicate that the regular expression is to be matched in a
		   case-insensitive way.

	 A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.

	 A command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces that
	 match the address.

	 A command line with two addresses selects an inclusive range.  This range
	 starts with the first pattern space that matches the first address.  The
	 end of the range is the next following pattern space that matches the
	 second address.  If the second address is a number less than or equal to
	 the line number first selected, only that line is selected.  The number
	 in the second address may be prefixed with a (“+”) to specify the number
	 of lines to match after the first pattern.  In the case when the second
	 address is a context address, sed does not re-match the second address
	 against the pattern space that matched the first address.	Starting at
	 the first line following the selected range, sed starts looking again for
	 the first address.

	 Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of
	 the exclamation character (“!”) function.

Sed Regular Expressions
	 The regular expressions used in sed, by default, are basic regular
	 expressions (BREs, see re_format(7) for more information), but extended
	 (modern) regular expressions can be used instead if the -E flag is given.
	 In addition, sed has the following two additions to regular expressions:

	 1.   In a context address, any character other than a backslash (“\”) or
	  newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression.
	  The opening delimiter needs to be preceded by a backslash unless it
	  is a slash.  For example, the context address \xabcx is equivalent
	  to /abc/.  Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting
	  character within the regular expression causes the character to be
	  treated literally.  For example, in the context address \xabc\xdefx,
	  the RE delimiter is an “x” and the second “x” stands for itself, so
	  that the regular expression is “abcxdef”.

	 2.   The escape sequence \n matches a newline character embedded in the
	  pattern space.  You cannot, however, use a literal newline character
	  in an address or in the substitute command.

	 One special feature of sed regular expressions is that they can default
	 to the last regular expression used.  If a regular expression is empty,
	 i.e., just the delimiter characters are specified, the last regular
	 expression encountered is used instead.  The last regular expression is
	 defined as the last regular expression used as part of an address or
	 substitute command, and at run-time, not compile-time.  For example, the
	 command “/abc/s//XXX/” will substitute “XXX” for the pattern “abc”.

Sed Functions
	 In the following list of commands, the maximum number of permissible
	 addresses for each command is indicated by [0addr], [1addr], or [2addr],
	 representing zero, one, or two addresses.

	 The argument text consists of one or more lines.  To embed a newline in
	 the text, precede it with a backslash.  Other backslashes in text are
	 deleted and the following character taken literally.

	 The “r” and “w” functions take an optional file parameter, which should
	 be separated from the function letter by white space.  Each file given as
	 an argument to sed is created (or its contents truncated) before any
	 input processing begins.

	 The “b”, “r”, “s”, “t”, “w”, “y”, “!”, and “:” functions all accept
	 additional arguments.  The following synopses indicate which arguments
	 have to be separated from the function letters by white space characters.

	 Two of the functions take a function-list.  This is a list of sed
	 functions separated by newlines, as follows:

	   { function
		 function
		 ...
		 function
	   }

	 The “{” can be preceded by white space and can be followed by white
	 space.  The function can be preceded by white space.  The terminating “}”
	 must be preceded by a newline, and may also be preceded by white space.

	 [2addr] function-list
		 Execute function-list only when the pattern space is selected.

	 [1addr]a\
	 text    Write text to standard output immediately before each attempt to
		 read a line of input, whether by executing the “N” function or by
		 beginning a new cycle.

	 [2addr]b[label]
		 Branch to the “:” function with the specified label.  If the
		 label is not specified, branch to the end of the script.

	 [2addr]c\
	 text    Delete the pattern space.	With 0 or 1 address or at the end of a
		 2-address range, text is written to the standard output.

	 [2addr]d
		 Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.

	 [2addr]D
		 Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first
		 newline character and start the next cycle.

	 [2addr]g
		 Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of
		 the hold space.

	 [2addr]G
		 Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold
		 space to the pattern space.

	 [2addr]h
		 Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the
		 pattern space.

	 [2addr]H
		 Append a newline character followed by the contents of the
		 pattern space to the hold space.

	 [1addr]i\
	 text    Write text to the standard output.

	 [2addr]l
		 (The letter ell.)	Write the pattern space to the standard output
		 in a visually unambiguous form.  This form is as follows:

		   backslash	      \\
		   alert	      \a
		   form-feed	      \f
		   carriage-return    \r
		   tab		      \t
		   vertical tab       \v

		 Nonprintable characters are written as three-digit octal numbers
		 (with a preceding backslash) for each byte in the character (most
		 significant byte first).  Long lines are folded, with the point
		 of folding indicated by displaying a backslash followed by a
		 newline.  The end of each line is marked with a “$”.

	 [2addr]n
		 Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default
		 output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space
		 with the next line of input.

	 [2addr]N
		 Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an
		 embedded newline character to separate the appended material from
		 the original contents.  Note that the current line number
		 changes.

	 [2addr]p
		 Write the pattern space to standard output.

	 [2addr]P
		 Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the
		 standard output.

	 [1addr]q
		 Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new
		 cycle.

	 [1addr]r file
		 Copy the contents of file to the standard output immediately
		 before the next attempt to read a line of input.  If file cannot
		 be read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error
		 condition is set.

	 [2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags
		 Substitute the replacement string for the first instance of the
		 regular expression in the pattern space.  Any character other
		 than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to
		 delimit the RE and the replacement.  Within the RE and the
		 replacement, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal
		 character if it is preceded by a backslash.

		 An ampersand (“&”) appearing in the replacement is replaced by
		 the string matching the RE.  The special meaning of “&” in this
		 context can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash.	The
		 string “\#”, where “#” is a digit, is replaced by the text
		 matched by the corresponding backreference expression (see
		 re_format(7)).

		 A line can be split by substituting a newline character into it.
		 To specify a newline character in the replacement string, precede
		 it with a backslash.

		 The value of flags in the substitute function is zero or more of
		 the following:

		   N	   Make the substitution only for the N'th occurrence
			   of the regular expression in the pattern space.

		   g	   Make the substitution for all non-overlapping
			   matches of the regular expression, not just the
			   first one.

		   p	   Write the pattern space to standard output if a
			   replacement was made.  If the replacement string is
			   identical to that which it replaces, it is still
			   considered to have been a replacement.

		   w file  Append the pattern space to file if a replacement
			   was made.  If the replacement string is identical
			   to that which it replaces, it is still considered
			   to have been a replacement.

		   i or I  Match the regular expression in a case-insensitive
			   way.

     [2addr]t [label]
	     Branch to the “:” function bearing the label if any substitutions
	     have been made since the most recent reading of an input line or
	     execution of a “t” function.  If no label is specified, branch to
	     the end of the script.

     [2addr]w file
	     Append the pattern space to the file.

     [2addr]x
	     Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.

     [2addr]y/string1/string2/
	     Replace all occurrences of characters in string1 in the pattern
	     space with the corresponding characters from string2.  Any
	     character other than a backslash or newline can be used instead
	     of a slash to delimit the strings.  Within string1 and string2, a
	     backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that
		 literal character, and a backslash followed by an ``n'' is
	     replaced by a newline character.

     [2addr]!function
     [2addr]!function-list
	     Apply the function or function-list only to the lines that are
	     not selected by the address(es).

     [0addr]:label
	     This function does nothing; it bears a label to which the “b” and
	     “t” commands may branch.

     [1addr]=
	     Write the line number to the standard output followed by a
	     newline character.

     [0addr]
	     Empty lines are ignored.

     [0addr]#
	     The “#” and the remainder of the line are ignored (treated as a
	     comment), with the single exception that if the first two
	     characters in the file are “#n”, the default output is
	     suppressed.  This is the same as specifying the -n option on the
	     command line.



### awk

## NAME

       awk - pattern-directed scanning and processing language


## SYNOPSIS

	   awk [ -F fs ] [ -v var=value ] [ 'prog' | -f progfile ] [ file ...  ]


## DESCRIPTION

       Awk scans each input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns
       specified literally in prog or in one or more files specified as -f
       progfile.  With each pattern there can be an associated action that
       will be performed when a line of a file matches the pattern.  Each line
       is matched against the pattern portion of every pattern-action
       statement; the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.
       The file name - means the standard input.  Any file of the form
       var=value is treated as an assignment, not a filename, and is executed
       at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.  The
       option -v followed by var=value is an assignment to be done before prog
       is executed; any number of -v options may be present.  The -F fs option
       defines the input field separator to be the regular expression fs.

       An input line is normally made up of fields separated by white space,
       or by the regular expression FS.  The fields are denoted $1, $2, ...,
       while $0 refers to the entire line.  If FS is null, the input line is
       split into one field per character.

       A pattern-action statement has the form:

	      pattern { action }

       A missing { action } means print the line; a missing pattern always
       matches.  Pattern-action statements are separated by newlines or
       semicolons.

       An action is a sequence of statements.  A statement can be one of the
       following:

	      if( expression ) statement [ else statement ]
	      while( expression ) statement
	      for( expression ; expression ; expression ) statement
	      for( var in array ) statement
	      do statement while( expression )
	      break
	      continue
	      { [ statement ... ] }
	      expression	      # commonly var = expression
	      print [ expression-list ] [ > expression ]
	      printf format [ , expression-list ] [ > expression ]
	      return [ expression ]
	      next		      # skip remaining patterns on this input line
	      nextfile		      # skip rest of this file, open next, start at top
	      delete array[ expression ]# delete an array element
	      delete array	      # delete all elements of array
	      exit [ expression ]     # exit immediately; status is expression

       Statements are terminated by semicolons, newlines or right braces.  An
       empty expression-list stands for $0.  String constants are quoted " ",
       with the usual C escapes recognized within.  Expressions take on string
       or numeric values as appropriate, and are built using the operators + -
       * / % ^ (exponentiation), and concatenation (indicated by white space).
       The operators ! ++ -- += -= *= /= %= ^= > >= < <= == != ?: are also
       available in expressions.  Variables may be scalars, array elements
       (denoted x[i]) or fields.  Variables are initialized to the null
       string.	Array subscripts may be any string, not necessarily numeric;
       this allows for a form of associative memory.  Multiple subscripts such
       as [i,j,k] are permitted; the constituents are concatenated, separated
       by the value of SUBSEP.

       The print statement prints its arguments on the standard output (or on
       a file if > file  or >> file  is present or on a pipe if | cmd  is
       present), separated by the current output field separator, and
       terminated by the output record separator.  file and cmd may be literal
       names or parenthesized expressions; identical string values in
       different statements denote the same open file.	The printf statement
       formats its expression list according to the format (see printf(3)).
       The built-in function close(expr) closes the file or pipe expr.	The
       built-in function fflush(expr) flushes any buffered output for the file
       or pipe expr.

       The mathematical functions atan2, cos, exp, log, sin, and sqrt are
       built in.  Other built-in functions:


       length
	    the length of its argument taken as a string, number of elements
	    in an array for an array argument, or length of $0 if no argument.
       rand random number on [0,1).
       srand
	    sets seed for rand and returns the previous seed.
       int  truncates to an integer value.
       substr(s, m [, n])
	    the n-character substring of s that begins at position m counted
	    from 1.  If no n, use the rest of the string.
       index(s, t)
	    the position in s where the string t occurs, or 0 if it does not.
       match(s, r)
	    the position in s where the regular expression r occurs, or 0 if
	    it does not.  The variables RSTART and RLENGTH are set to the
	    position and length of the matched string.
       split(s, a [, fs])
	    splits the string s into array elements a[1], a[2], ..., a[n], and
	    returns n.	The separation is done with the regular expression fs
	    or with the field separator FS if fs is not given.	An empty
	    string as field separator splits the string into one array element
	    per character.
       sub(r, t [, s])
	    substitutes t for the first occurrence of the regular expression r
	    in the string s.  If s is not given, $0 is used.
       gsub(r, t [, s])
	    same as sub except that all occurrences of the regular expression
	    are replaced; sub and gsub return the number of replacements.
       sprintf(fmt, expr, ...)
	    the string resulting from formatting expr ...  according to the
	    printf(3) format fmt.
       system(cmd)
	    executes cmd and returns its exit status. This will be -1 upon
		error, cmd's exit status upon a normal exit, 256 + sig upon death-
		by-signal, where sig is the number of the murdering signal, or 512
		+ sig if there was a core dump.
	   tolower(str)
		returns a copy of str with all upper-case characters translated to
		their corresponding lower-case equivalents.
	   toupper(str)
		returns a copy of str with all lower-case characters translated to
		their corresponding upper-case equivalents.

	   The ``function'' getline sets $0 to the next input record from the
	   current input file; getline < file  sets $0 to the next record from
	   file.  getline x sets variable x instead.  Finally, cmd | getline
	   pipes the output of cmd into getline; each call of getline returns the
	   next line of output from cmd.  In all cases, getline returns 1 for a
	   successful input, 0 for end of file, and -1 for an error.

	   Patterns are arbitrary Boolean combinations (with ! || &&) of regular
	   expressions and relational expressions.	Regular expressions are as
	   defined in re_format(7).  Isolated regular expressions in a pattern
	   apply to the entire line.  Regular expressions may also occur in
	   relational expressions, using the operators ~ and !~.  /re/ is a
	   constant regular expression; any string (constant or variable) may be
	   used as a regular expression, except in the position of an isolated
	   regular expression in a pattern.

	   A pattern may consist of two patterns separated by a comma; in this
	   case, the action is performed for all lines from an occurrence of the
	   first pattern though an occurrence of the second.

	   A relational expression is one of the following:

		  expression matchop regular-expression
		  expression relop expression
		  expression in array-name
		  (expr,expr,...) in array-name

	   where a relop is any of the six relational operators in C, and a
	   matchop is either ~ (matches) or !~ (does not match).  A conditional is
	   an arithmetic expression, a relational expression, or a Boolean
	   combination of these.

	   The special patterns BEGIN and END may be used to capture control
	   before the first input line is read and after the last.	BEGIN and END
	   do not combine with other patterns.  They may appear multiple times in
	   a program and execute in the order they are read by awk.

	   Variable names with special meanings:


	   ARGC argument count, assignable.
	   ARGV argument array, assignable; non-null members are taken as
		filenames.
	   CONVFMT
		conversion format used when converting numbers (default %.6g).
	   ENVIRON
		array of environment variables; subscripts are names.
	   FILENAME
		the name of the current input file.
	   FNR  ordinal number of the current record in the current file.
	   FS   regular expression used to separate fields; also settable by
		option -Ffs.
	   NF   number of fields in the current record.
	   NR   ordinal number of the current record.
	   OFMT output format for numbers (default %.6g).
	   OFS  output field separator (default space).
	   ORS  output record separator (default newline).
	   RLENGTH
		the length of a string matched by match.
	   RS   input record separator (default newline).  If empty, blank lines
		separate records.  If more than one character long, RS is treated
		as a regular expression, and records are separated by text
		matching the expression.
	   RSTART
		the start position of a string matched by match.
	   SUBSEP
		separates multiple subscripts (default 034).

	   Functions may be defined (at the position of a pattern-action
	   statement) thus:

		  function foo(a, b, c) { ...; return x }

	   Parameters are passed by value if scalar and by reference if array
	   name; functions may be called recursively.  Parameters are local to the
	   function; all other variables are global.  Thus local variables may be
	   created by providing excess parameters in the function definition.



### sort

## NAME

	 sort – sort or merge records (lines) of text and binary files


## SYNOPSIS

	 sort [-bcCdfghiRMmnrsuVz] [-k field1[,field2]] [-S memsize] [-T dir] [-t
	  char] [-o output] [file ...]
	 sort --help
	 sort --version


## DESCRIPTION

	 The sort utility sorts text and binary files by lines.  A line is a
	 record separated from the subsequent record by a newline (default) or NUL
	 ´\0´ character (-z option).  A record can contain any printable or
	 unprintable characters.  Comparisons are based on one or more sort keys
	 extracted from each line of input, and are performed lexicographically,
	 according to the current locale's collating rules and the specified
     command-line options that can tune the actual sorting behavior.  By
     default, if keys are not given, sort uses entire lines for comparison.

     The command line options are as follows:

     -c, --check, -C, --check=silent|quiet
	     Check that the single input file is sorted.  If the file is not
	     sorted, sort produces the appropriate error messages and exits
	     with code 1, otherwise returns 0.	If -C or --check=silent is
	     specified, sort produces no output.  This is a "silent" version
	     of -c.

     -m, --merge
	     Merge only.  The input files are assumed to be pre-sorted.  If
	     they are not sorted the output order is undefined.

     -o output, --output=output
	     Print the output to the output file instead of the standard
	     output.

     -S size, --buffer-size=size
	     Use size for the maximum size of the memory buffer.  Size
	     modifiers %,b,K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y can be used.  If a memory limit is
	     not explicitly specified, sort takes up to about 90% of available
	     memory.  If the file size is too big to fit into the memory
	     buffer, the temporary disk files are used to perform the sorting.

     -T dir, --temporary-directory=dir
	     Store temporary files in the directory dir.  The default path is
	     the value of the environment variable TMPDIR or /var/tmp if
	     TMPDIR is not defined.

     -u, --unique
	     Unique keys.  Suppress all lines that have a key that is equal to
	     an already processed one.	This option, similarly to -s, implies
	     a stable sort.  If used with -c or -C, sort also checks that
	     there are no lines with duplicate keys.

     -s      Stable sort.  This option maintains the original record order of
	     records that have an equal key.  This is a non-standard feature,
	     but it is widely accepted and used.

     --version
	     Print the version and silently exits.

     --help  Print the help text and silently exits.

     The following options override the default ordering rules.  When ordering
     options appear independently of key field specifications, they apply
     globally to all sort keys.  When attached to a specific key (see -k), the
     ordering options override all global ordering options for the key they
     are attached to.

     -b, --ignore-leading-blanks
	     Ignore leading blank characters when comparing lines.

     -d, --dictionary-order
	     Consider only blank spaces and alphanumeric characters in
	     comparisons.

     -f, --ignore-case
	     Convert all lowercase characters to their uppercase equivalent
	     before comparison, that is, perform case-independent sorting.

     -g, --general-numeric-sort, --sort=general-numeric
	     Sort by general numerical value.  As opposed to -n, this option
	     handles general floating points.  It has a more permissive format
	     than that allowed by -n but it has a significant performance
	     drawback.

     -h, --human-numeric-sort, --sort=human-numeric
	     Sort by numerical value, but take into account the SI suffix, if
	     present.  Sort first by numeric sign (negative, zero, or
		 positive); then by SI suffix (either empty, or `k' or `K', or one
		 of `MGTPEZY', in that order); and finally by numeric value.  The
		 SI suffix must immediately follow the number.  For example,
		 '12345K' sorts before '1M', because M is "larger" than K.	This
		 sort option is useful for sorting the output of a single
		 invocation of 'df' command with -h or -H options (human-
		 readable).

	 -i, --ignore-nonprinting
		 Ignore all non-printable characters.

	 -M, --month-sort, --sort=month
		 Sort by month abbreviations.  Unknown strings are considered
		 smaller than the month names.

	 -n, --numeric-sort, --sort=numeric
		 Sort fields numerically by arithmetic value.  Fields are supposed
		 to have optional blanks in the beginning, an optional minus sign,
		 zero or more digits (including decimal point and possible
		 thousand separators).

	 -R, --random-sort, --sort=random
		 Sort by a random order.  This is a random permutation of the
		 inputs except that the equal keys sort together.  It is
		 implemented by hashing the input keys and sorting the hash
		 values.  The hash function is chosen randomly.  The hash function
		 is randomized by /dev/random content, or by file content if it is
		 specified by --random-source.  Even if multiple sort fields are
		 specified, the same random hash function is used for all of them.

	 -r, --reverse
		 Sort in reverse order.

	 -V, --version-sort
		 Sort version numbers.  The input lines are treated as file names
		 in form PREFIX VERSION SUFFIX, where SUFFIX matches the regular
		 expression "(.([A-Za-z~][A-Za-z0-9~]*)?)*".  The files are
		 compared by their prefixes and versions (leading zeros are
		 ignored in version numbers, see example below).  If an input
		 string does not match the pattern, then it is compared using the
		 byte compare function.  All string comparisons are performed in C
		 locale, the locale environment setting is ignored.

		 Example:

		 $ ls sort* | sort -V

		 sort-1.022.tgz

		 sort-1.23.tgz

		 sort-1.23.1.tgz

		 sort-1.024.tgz

		 sort-1.024.003.

		 sort-1.024.003.tgz

		 sort-1.024.07.tgz

		 sort-1.024.009.tgz

	 The treatment of field separators can be altered using these options:

	 -b, --ignore-leading-blanks
		 Ignore leading blank space when determining the start and end of
		 a restricted sort key (see -k).  If -b is specified before the
		 first -k option, it applies globally to all key specifications.
		 Otherwise, -b can be attached independently to each field
		 argument of the key specifications.  Note that sort keys
		 specified with the -k option may have a variable number of
		 leading whitespace characters that will affect the result, as
		 described below in the -t option description.

	 -k field1[,field2], --key=field1[,field2]
		 Define a restricted sort key that has the starting position
		 field1, and optional ending position field2 of a key field.  The
		 -k option may be specified multiple times, in which case
		 subsequent keys are compared when earlier keys compare equal.
		 The -k option replaces the obsolete options +pos1 and -pos2, but
		 the old notation is also supported.

	 -t char, --field-separator=char
		 Use char as a field separator character.  The initial char is not
		 considered to be part of a field when determining key offsets.
		 Each occurrence of char is significant (for example, “charchar”
		 delimits an empty field).	If -t is not specified, the default
		 field separator is a sequence of blank space characters, and
		 consecutive blank spaces do not delimit an empty field, however,
		 the initial blank space is considered part of a field when
		 determining key offsets.  To use NUL as field separator, use -t
		 ´\0´.

	 -z, --zero-terminated
		 Use NUL as record separator.  By default, records in the files
		 are supposed to be separated by the newline characters.  With
		 this option, NUL (´\0´) is used as a record separator character.

	 Other options:

	 --batch-size=num
		 Specify maximum number of files that can be opened by sort at
		 once.  This option affects behavior when having many input files
		 or using temporary files.	The default value is 16.

	 --compress-program=PROGRAM
		 Use PROGRAM to compress temporary files.  PROGRAM must compress
		 standard input to standard output, when called without arguments.
		 When called with argument -d it must decompress standard input to
		 standard output.  If PROGRAM fails, sort must exit with error.
		 An example of PROGRAM that can be used here is bzip2.

	 --random-source=filename
		 In random sort, the file content is used as the source of the
		 'seed' data for the hash function choice.	Two invocations of
		 random sort with the same seed data will use the same hash
		 function and will produce the same result if the input is also
		 identical.  By default, file /dev/random is used.

	 --debug
		 Print some extra information about the sorting process to the
		 standard output.

	 --parallel
		 Set the maximum number of execution threads.  Default number
		 equals to the number of CPUs.

	 --files0-from=filename
		 Take the input file list from the file filename.  The file names
		 must be separated by NUL (like the output produced by the command
		 "find ... -print0").

	 --radixsort
		 Try to use radix sort, if the sort specifications allow.  The
		 radix sort can only be used for trivial locales (C and POSIX),
		 and it cannot be used for numeric or month sort.  Radix sort is
		 very fast and stable.

	 --mergesort
		 Use mergesort.  This is a universal algorithm that can always be
		 used, but it is not always the fastest.

	 --qsort
		 Try to use quick sort, if the sort specifications allow.  This
		 sort algorithm cannot be used with -u and -s.

	 --heapsort
		 Try to use heap sort, if the sort specifications allow.  This
		 sort algorithm cannot be used with -u and -s.

	 --mmap  Try to use file memory mapping system call.  It may increase
		 speed in some cases.

	 The following operands are available:

	 file    The pathname of a file to be sorted, merged, or checked.  If no
		 file operands are specified, or if a file operand is -, the
		 standard input is used.

	 A field is defined as a maximal sequence of characters other than the
	 field separator and record separator (newline by default).  Initial blank
	 spaces are included in the field unless -b has been specified; the first
	 blank space of a sequence of blank spaces acts as the field separator and
	 is included in the field (unless -t is specified).  For example, all
	 blank spaces at the beginning of a line are considered to be part of the
	 first field.

	 Fields are specified by the -k field1[,field2] command-line option.  If
	 field2 is missing, the end of the key defaults to the end of the line.

	 The arguments field1 and field2 have the form m.n (m,n > 0) and can be
	 followed by one or more of the modifiers b, d, f, i, n, g, M and r, which
	 correspond to the options discussed above.  When b is specified it
	 applies only to field1 or field2 where it is specified while the rest of
	 the modifiers apply to the whole key field regardless if they are
	 specified only with field1 or field2 or both.  A field1 position
	 specified by m.n is interpreted as the nth character from the beginning
	 of the mth field.	A missing .n in field1 means ‘.1’, indicating the
	 first character of the mth field; if the -b option is in effect, n is
	 counted from the first non-blank character in the mth field; m.1b refers
	 to the first non-blank character in the mth field.  1.n refers to the nth
	 character from the beginning of the line; if n is greater than the length
	 of the line, the field is taken to be empty.

	 nth positions are always counted from the field beginning, even if the
	 field is shorter than the number of specified positions.  Thus, the key
	 can really start from a position in a subsequent field.

	 A field2 position specified by m.n is interpreted as the nth character
	 (including separators) from the beginning of the mth field.  A missing .n
	 indicates the last character of the mth field; m = 0 designates the end
	 of a line.  Thus the option -k v.x,w.y is synonymous with the obsolete
	 option +v-1.x-1 -w-1.y; when y is omitted, -k v.x,w is synonymous with
	 +v-1.x-1 -w.0.  The obsolete +pos1 -pos2 option is still supported,
	 except for -w.0b, which has no -k equivalent.



### uniq

## NAME

	 uniq – report or filter out repeated lines in a file


## SYNOPSIS

	 uniq [-cdiu] [-D[septype]] [-f num] [-s chars] [input_file [output_file]]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The uniq utility reads the specified input_file comparing adjacent lines,
	 and writes a copy of each unique input line to the output_file.  If
	 input_file is a single dash (‘-’) or absent, the standard input is read.
	 If output_file is absent, standard output is used for output.  The second
	 and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.
	 Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not
	 adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the files first.

	 The following options are available:

	 -c, --count
		 Precede each output line with the count of the number of times
		 the line occurred in the input, followed by a single space.

	 -d, --repeated
		 Output a single copy of each line that is repeated in the input.
		 Ignored if -D is also specified.

	 -D, --all-repeated [septype]
		 Output all lines that are repeated (like -d, but each copy of the
		 repeated line is written).  The optional septype argument
		 controls how to separate groups of repeated lines in the output;
		 it must be one of the following values:

		 none      Do not separate groups of lines (this is the default).
		 prepend   Output an empty line before each group of lines.
		 separate  Output an empty line after each group of lines.

	 -f num, --skip-fields num
		 Ignore the first num fields in each input line when doing
		 comparisons.  A field is a string of non-blank characters
		 separated from adjacent fields by blanks.	Field numbers are one
		 based, i.e., the first field is field one.

	 -i, --ignore-case
		 Case insensitive comparison of lines.

	 -s chars, --skip-chars chars
		 Ignore the first chars characters in each input line when doing
		 comparisons.  If specified in conjunction with the -f, --unique
		 option, the first chars characters after the first num fields
		 will be ignored.  Character numbers are one based, i.e., the
		 first character is character one.

	 -u, --unique
		 Only output lines that are not repeated in the input.



### cut

## NAME

	 cut – cut out selected portions of each line of a file


## SYNOPSIS

	 cut -b list [-n] [file ...]
	 cut -c list [file ...]
	 cut -f list [-w | -d delim] [-s] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The cut utility cuts out selected portions of each line (as specified by
	 list) from each file and writes them to the standard output.  If no file
	 arguments are specified, or a file argument is a single dash (‘-’), cut
	 reads from the standard input.  The items specified by list can be in
	 terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited by a special
	 character.  Column and field numbering start from 1.

	 The list option argument is a comma or whitespace separated set of
	 numbers and/or number ranges.  Number ranges consist of a number, a dash
	 (‘-’), and a second number and select the columns or fields from the
	 first number to the second, inclusive.  Numbers or number ranges may be
	 preceded by a dash, which selects all columns or fields from 1 to the
	 last number.  Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which
	 selects all columns or fields from the last number to the end of the
	 line.  Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any
	 order.  If a field or column is specified multiple times, it will appear
	 only once in the output.  It is not an error to select columns or fields
	 not present in the input line.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -b list
		 The list specifies byte positions.

	 -c list
		 The list specifies character positions.

	 -d delim
		 Use delim as the field delimiter character instead of the tab
		 character.

	 -f list
		 The list specifies fields, separated in the input by the field
		 delimiter character (see the -d option).  Output fields are
		 separated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter
		 character.

	 -n      Do not split multi-byte characters.  Characters will only be
		 output if at least one byte is selected, and, after a prefix of
		 zero or more unselected bytes, the rest of the bytes that form
		 the character are selected.

	 -s      Suppress lines with no field delimiter characters.  Unless
		 specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through
		 unmodified.

	 -w      Use whitespace (spaces and tabs) as the delimiter.  Consecutive
		 spaces and tabs count as one single field separator.



### tr

## NAME

	 tr – translate characters


## SYNOPSIS

	 tr [-Ccsu] string1 string2
	 tr [-Ccu] -d string1
	 tr [-Ccu] -s string1
	 tr [-Ccu] -ds string1 string2


## DESCRIPTION

	 The tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with
	 substitution or deletion of selected characters.

	 The following options are available:

	 -C      Complement the set of characters in string1, that is “-C ab”
		 includes every character except for ‘a’ and ‘b’.

	 -c      Same as -C but complement the set of values in string1.

	 -d      Delete characters in string1 from the input.

	 -s      Squeeze multiple occurrences of the characters listed in the last
		 operand (either string1 or string2) in the input into a single
		 instance of the character.  This occurs after all deletion and
		 translation is completed.

	 -u      Guarantee that any output is unbuffered.

	 In the first synopsis form, the characters in string1 are translated into
	 the characters in string2 where the first character in string1 is
	 translated into the first character in string2 and so on.	If string1 is
	 longer than string2, the last character found in string2 is duplicated
	 until string1 is exhausted.

	 In the second synopsis form, the characters in string1 are deleted from
	 the input.

	 In the third synopsis form, the characters in string1 are compressed as
	 described for the -s option.

	 In the fourth synopsis form, the characters in string1 are deleted from
	 the input, and the characters in string2 are compressed as described for
	 the -s option.

	 The following conventions can be used in string1 and string2 to specify
	 sets of characters:

	 character	Any character not described by one of the following
		conventions represents itself.

	 \octal	A backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits represents a
		character with that encoded value.  To follow an octal
		sequence with a digit as a character, left zero-pad the octal
		sequence to the full 3 octal digits.

	 \character
		A backslash followed by certain special characters maps to
		special values.

		\a    <alert character>
		\b    <backspace>
		\f    <form-feed>
		\n    <newline>
		\r    <carriage return>
		\t    <tab>
		\v    <vertical tab>

		A backslash followed by any other character maps to that
		character.

	 c-c	For non-octal range endpoints represents the range of
		characters between the range endpoints, inclusive, in
		ascending order, as defined by the collation sequence.	If
		either or both of the range endpoints are octal sequences, it
		represents the range of specific coded values between the
		range endpoints, inclusive.

		See the COMPATIBILITY section below for an important note
		regarding differences in the way the current implementation
		interprets range expressions differently from previous
		implementations.

	 [:class:]	Represents all characters belonging to the defined character
		class.	Class names are:

		alnum	     <alphanumeric characters>
		alpha	     <alphabetic characters>
		blank	     <whitespace characters>
		cntrl	     <control characters>
		digit	     <numeric characters>
		graph	     <graphic characters>
		ideogram     <ideographic characters>
		lower	     <lower-case alphabetic characters>
		phonogram    <phonographic characters>
		print	     <printable characters>
		punct	     <punctuation characters>
		rune	     <valid characters>
		space	     <space characters>
		special      <special characters>
		upper	     <upper-case characters>
		xdigit	     <hexadecimal characters>

		When “[:lower:]” appears in string1 and “[:upper:]” appears in
		the same relative position in string2, it represents the
		characters pairs from the toupper mapping in the LC_CTYPE
		category of the current locale.  When “[:upper:]” appears in
		string1 and “[:lower:]” appears in the same relative position
		in string2, it represents the characters pairs from the
		tolower mapping in the LC_CTYPE category of the current
		locale.

		With the exception of case conversion, characters in the
		classes are in unspecified order.

		For specific information as to which ASCII characters are
		included in these classes, see ctype(3) and related manual
		pages.

	 [=equiv=]	Represents all characters belonging to the same equivalence
		class as equiv, ordered by their encoded values.

	 [#*n]	Represents n repeated occurrences of the character represented
		by #.  This expression is only valid when it occurs in
		string2.  If n is omitted or is zero, it is be interpreted as
		large enough to extend string2 sequence to the length of
		string1.  If n has a leading zero, it is interpreted as an
		octal value, otherwise, it is interpreted as a decimal value.



### wc

## NAME

	 wc – word, line, character, and byte count


## SYNOPSIS

	 wc [--libxo] [-Lclmw] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained
	 in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the
	 standard output.  A line is defined as a string of characters delimited
	 by a ⟨newline⟩ character.	Characters beyond the final ⟨newline⟩
	 character will not be included in the line count.

	 A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space
	 characters.  White space characters are the set of characters for which
	 the iswspace(3) function returns true.  If more than one input file is
	 specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on
	 a separate line after the output for the last file.

	 The following options are available:

	 --libxo
		 Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
		 and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details
		 on command line arguments.

	 -L      Write the length of the line containing the most bytes (default)
		 or characters (when -m is provided) to standard output.  When
		 more than one file argument is specified, the longest input line
		 of all files is reported as the value of the final “total”.

	 -c      The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard
		 output.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.

	 -l      The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard
		 output.

	 -m      The number of characters in each input file is written to the
		 standard output.  If the current locale does not support
		 multibyte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.  This
		 will cancel out any prior usage of the -c option.

	 -w      The number of words in each input file is written to the standard
		 output.

	 When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by
	 that option.  The order of output always takes the form of line, word,
	 byte, and file name.  The default action is equivalent to specifying the
	 -c, -l and -w options.

	 If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is
	 displayed.  The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF, or [^D] in
	 most environments.

	 If wc receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal,
	 the interim data will be written to the standard error output in the same
	 format as the standard completion message.



### head

## NAME

	 head – display first lines of a file


## SYNOPSIS

	 head [-n count | -c bytes] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 This filter displays the first count lines or bytes of each of the
	 specified files, or of the standard input if no files are specified.  If
	 count is omitted it defaults to 10.

	 The following options are available:

	 -c bytes, --bytes=bytes
		 Print bytes of each of the specified files.

	 -n count, --lines=count
		 Print count lines of each of the specified files.

	 If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a
	 header consisting of the string “==> XXX <==” where “XXX” is the name of
	 the file.



### tail

## NAME

	 tail – display the last part of a file


## SYNOPSIS

	 tail [-F | -f | -r] [-qv] [-b number | -c number | -n number] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The tail utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its
	 standard input, to the standard output.

	 The display begins at a byte, line or 512-byte block location in the
	 input.  Numbers having a leading plus (‘+’) sign are relative to the
	 beginning of the input, for example, “-c +2” starts the display at the
	 second byte of the input.	Numbers having a leading minus (‘-’) sign or
	 no explicit sign are relative to the end of the input, for example, “-n
	 2” displays the last two lines of the input.  The default starting
	 location is “-n 10”, or the last 10 lines of the input.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -b number, --blocks=number
		 The location is number 512-byte blocks.

	 -c number, --bytes=number
		 The location is number bytes.

	 -f      The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is
		 reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to
		 the input.  The -f option is ignored if the standard input is a
		 pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.

	 -F      The -F option implies the -f option, but tail will also check to
		 see if the file being followed has been renamed or rotated.  The
		 file is closed and reopened when tail detects that the filename
		 being read from has a new inode number.

		 If the file being followed does not (yet) exist or if it is
		 removed, tail will keep looking and will display the file from
		 the beginning if and when it is created.

		 The -F option is the same as the -f option if reading from
		 standard input rather than a file.

	 -n number, --lines=number
		 The location is number lines.

	 -q, --quiet, --silent
		 Suppresses printing of headers when multiple files are being
		 examined.

	 -r      The -r option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order,
		 by line.  Additionally, this option changes the meaning of the
		 -b, -c and -n options.  When the -r option is specified, these
		 options specify the number of bytes, lines or 512-byte blocks to
		 display, instead of the bytes, lines or blocks from the beginning
		 or end of the input from which to begin the display.  The default
		 for the -r option is to display all of the input.

	 -v, --verbose
		 Prepend each file with a header.

	 If more than a single file is specified, or if the -v option is used,
	 each file is preceded by a header consisting of the string “==> XXX <==”
	 where XXX is the name of the file.  The -q flag disables the printing of
	 the header in all cases.

	 All number arguments may also be specified with size suffixes supported
	 by expand_number(3).



### less

## NAME

	   less - opposite of more


## SYNOPSIS

	   less -?
	   less --help
	   less -V
	   less --version
	   less [-[+]aABcCdeEfFgGiIJKLmMnNqQrRsSuUVwWX~]
		[-b space] [-h lines] [-j line] [-k keyfile]
		[-{oO} logfile] [-p pattern] [-P prompt] [-t tag]
		[-T tagsfile] [-x tab,...] [-y lines] [-[z] lines]
		[-# shift] [+[+]cmd] [--] [filename]...
	   (See the OPTIONS section for alternate option syntax with long option
	   names.)


## DESCRIPTION

	   Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward
	   movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not
	   have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
	   files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).	Less uses
	   termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
	   terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On
	   a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the
	   screen are prefixed with a caret.)

	   Commands are based on both more and vi.	Commands may be preceded by a
	   decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used
	   by some commands, as indicated.



### more

## NAME

	   less - opposite of more


## SYNOPSIS

	   less -?
	   less --help
	   less -V

### echo

## NAME

	 echo – write arguments to the standard output


## SYNOPSIS

	 echo [-n] [string ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
	 (‘ ’) characters and followed by a newline (‘\n’) character, to the
	 standard output.

	 The following option is available:

	 -n    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be
	   achieved by appending ‘\c’ to the end of the string, as is done by
	   iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the
	   effect of ‘\c’ are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
	   (“POSIX.1”) as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for
	   maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to
	   suppress the newline character.

	 Some shells may provide a builtin echo command which is similar or
	 identical to this utility.  Most notably, the builtin echo in sh(1) does
	 not accept the -n option.	Consult the builtin(1) manual page.



### printf

## NAME

	 printf – formatted output


## SYNOPSIS

	 printf format [arguments ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The printf utility formats and prints its arguments, after the first,
	 under control of the format.  The format is a character string which
	 contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply
	 copied to standard output, character escape sequences which are converted
	 and copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of
	 which causes printing of the next successive argument.

	 The arguments after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding
	 format is either c, b or s; otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant,
	 with the following extensions:

	   •   A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.
	   •   If the leading character is a single or double quote, the value
		   is the character code of the next character.

	 The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the
	 arguments.  Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or
	 the null string.

	 Character escape sequences are in backslash notation as defined in the
	 ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”), with extensions.  The characters and their
	 meanings are as follows:

	   \a	   Write a <bell> character.
	   \b	   Write a <backspace> character.
	   \f	   Write a <form-feed> character.
	   \n	   Write a <new-line> character.
	   \r	   Write a <carriage return> character.
	   \t	   Write a <tab> character.
	   \v	   Write a <vertical tab> character.
	   \´	   Write a <single quote> character.
	   \\	   Write a backslash character.
	   \num    Write a byte whose value is the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit octal
		   number num.	Multibyte characters can be constructed using
		   multiple \num sequences.

	 Each format specification is introduced by the percent character (``%'').
	 The remainder of the format specification includes, in the following
	 order:

	 Zero or more of the following flags:

		 #	     A `#' character specifying that the value should be
			 printed in an ``alternate form''.	For b, c, d, s and u
		     formats, this option has no effect.  For the o formats
		     the precision of the number is increased to force the
		     first character of the output string to a zero.  For the
		     x (X) format, a non-zero result has the string 0x (0X)
		     prepended to it.  For a, A, e, E, f, F, g and G formats,
		     the result will always contain a decimal point, even if
		     no digits follow the point (normally, a decimal point
		     only appears in the results of those formats if a digit
		     follows the decimal point).  For g and G formats,
		     trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they
		     would otherwise be;

		 -	     A minus sign `-' which specifies left adjustment of the
			 output in the indicated field;

		 +	     A `+' character specifying that there should always be a
		     sign placed before the number when using signed formats.

	     ‘ ’     A space specifying that a blank should be left before a
			 positive number for a signed format.  A `+' overrides a
			 space if both are used;

		 0	     A zero `0' character indicating that zero-padding should
			 be used rather than blank-padding.  A `-' overrides a `0'
		     if both are used;

     Field Width:
	     An optional digit string specifying a field width; if the output
	     string has fewer bytes than the field width it will be blank-
	     padded on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment indicator
	     has been given) to make up the field width (note that a leading
	     zero is a flag, but an embedded zero is part of a field width);

     Precision:
	     An optional period, ‘.’, followed by an optional digit string
	     giving a precision which specifies the number of digits to appear
	     after the decimal point, for e and f formats, or the maximum
	     number of bytes to be printed from a string; if the digit string
	     is missing, the precision is treated as zero;

     Format:
	     A character which indicates the type of format to use (one of
	     diouxXfFeEgGaAcsb).  The uppercase formats differ from their
	     lowercase counterparts only in that the output of the former is
	     entirely in uppercase.  The floating-point format specifiers
	     (fFeEgGaA) may be prefixed by an L to request that additional
	     precision be used, if available.

     A field width or precision may be ‘*’ instead of a digit string.  In this
     case an argument supplies the field width or precision.

     The format characters and their meanings are:

     diouXx	 The argument is printed as a signed decimal (d or i),
		 unsigned octal, unsigned decimal, or unsigned hexadecimal (X
		 or x), respectively.

	 fF 	 The argument is printed in the style `[-]ddd.ddd' where the
		 number of d's after the decimal point is equal to the
		 precision specification for the argument.  If the precision
		 is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision is
		 explicitly 0, no digits and no decimal point are printed.
		 The values infinity and NaN are printed as ‘inf’ and ‘nan’,
		 respectively.

     eE 	 The argument is printed in the style e ‘[-d.ddd±dd]’ where
		 there is one digit before the decimal point and the number
		 after is equal to the precision specification for the
		 argument; when the precision is missing, 6 digits are
		 produced.  The values infinity and NaN are printed as ‘inf’
		 and ‘nan’, respectively.

     gG 	 The argument is printed in style f (F) or in style e (E)
		 whichever gives full precision in minimum space.

     aA 	 The argument is printed in style ‘[-h.hhh±pd]’ where there is
		 one digit before the hexadecimal point and the number after
		 is equal to the precision specification for the argument;
		 when the precision is missing, enough digits are produced to
		 convey the argument's exact double-precision floating-point
		 representation.  The values infinity and NaN are printed as
		 ‘inf’ and ‘nan’, respectively.

	 c		 The first byte of argument is printed.

	 s		 Bytes from the string argument are printed until the end is
		 reached or until the number of bytes indicated by the
		 precision specification is reached; however if the precision
		 is 0 or missing, the string is printed entirely.

	 b		 As for s, but interpret character escapes in backslash
		 notation in the string argument.  The permitted escape
		 sequences are slightly different in that octal escapes are
		 \0num instead of \num and that an additional escape sequence
		 \c stops further output from this printf invocation.

	 n$ 	 Allows reordering of the output according to argument.

	 %		 Print a `%'; no argument is used.

	 The decimal point character is defined in the program's locale (category
	 LC_NUMERIC).

	 In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
	 field; padding takes place only if the specified field width exceeds the
	 actual width.

	 Some shells may provide a builtin printf command which is similar or
	 identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.



### xargs

## NAME

	 xargs – construct argument list(s) and execute utility


## SYNOPSIS

	 xargs [-0oprt] [-E eofstr] [-I replstr [-R replacements] [-S replsize]]
	   [-J replstr] [-L number] [-n number [-x]] [-P maxprocs] [-s size]
	   [utility [argument ...]]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The xargs utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file delimited
	 strings from the standard input and executes utility with the strings as
	 arguments.

	 Any arguments specified on the command line are given to utility upon
	 each invocation, followed by some number of the arguments read from the
	 standard input of xargs.  This is repeated until standard input is
	 exhausted.

	 Spaces, tabs and newlines may be embedded in arguments using single
	 (`` ' '') or double (``"'') quotes or backslashes (``\'').  Single quotes
	 escape all non-single quote characters, excluding newlines, up to the
	 matching single quote.  Double quotes escape all non-double quote
	 characters, excluding newlines, up to the matching double quote.  Any
	 single character, including newlines, may be escaped by a backslash.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -0, --null
		 Change xargs to expect NUL (``\0'') characters as separators,
		 instead of spaces and newlines.  This is expected to be used in
		 concert with the -print0 function in find(1).

	 -E eofstr
		 Use eofstr as a logical EOF marker.

	 -I replstr
		 Execute utility for each input line, replacing one or more
		 occurrences of replstr in up to replacements (or 5 if no -R flag
		 is specified) arguments to utility with the entire line of input.
		 The resulting arguments, after replacement is done, will not be
		 allowed to grow beyond replsize (or 255 if no -S flag is
		 specified) bytes; this is implemented by concatenating as much of
		 the argument containing replstr as possible, to the constructed
		 arguments to utility, up to replsize bytes.  The size limit does
		 not apply to arguments to utility which do not contain replstr,
		 and furthermore, no replacement will be done on utility itself.
		 Implies -x.

	 -J replstr
		 If this option is specified, xargs will use the data read from
		 standard input to replace the first occurrence of replstr instead
		 of appending that data after all other arguments.	This option
		 will not affect how many arguments will be read from input (-n),
		 or the size of the command(s) xargs will generate (-s).  The
		 option just moves where those arguments will be placed in the
		 command(s) that are executed.  The replstr must show up as a
		 distinct argument to xargs.  It will not be recognized if, for
		 instance, it is in the middle of a quoted string.	Furthermore,
		 only the first occurrence of the replstr will be replaced.  For
		 example, the following command will copy the list of files and
		 directories which start with an uppercase letter in the current
		 directory to destdir:

		   /bin/ls -1d [A-Z]* | xargs -J % cp -Rp % destdir

	 -L number
		 Call utility for every number lines read.	If EOF is reached and
		 fewer lines have been read than number then utility will be
		 called with the available lines.

	 -n number, --max-args=number
		 Set the maximum number of arguments taken from standard input for
		 each invocation of utility.  An invocation of utility will use
		 less than number standard input arguments if the number of bytes
		 accumulated (see the -s option) exceeds the specified size or
		 there are fewer than number arguments remaining for the last
		 invocation of utility.  The current default value for number is
		 5000.

	 -o      Reopen stdin as /dev/tty in the child process before executing
		 the command.  This is useful if you want xargs to run an
		 interactive application.

	 -P maxprocs, --max-procs=maxprocs
		 Parallel mode: run at most maxprocs invocations of utility at
		 once.  If maxprocs is set to 0, xargs will run as many processes
		 as possible.

	 -p, --interactive
		 Echo each command to be executed and ask the user whether it
		 should be executed.  An affirmative response, ‘y’ in the POSIX
		 locale, causes the command to be executed, any other response
		 causes it to be skipped.  No commands are executed if the process
		 is not attached to a terminal.

	 -r, --no-run-if-empty
		 Compatibility with GNU xargs.  The GNU version of xargs runs the
		 utility argument at least once, even if xargs input is empty, and
		 it supports a -r option to inhibit this behavior.	The FreeBSD
		 version of xargs does not run the utility argument on empty
		 input, but it supports the -r option for command-line
		 compatibility with GNU xargs, but the -r option does nothing in
		 the FreeBSD version of xargs.

	 -R replacements
		 Specify the maximum number of arguments that -I will do
		 replacement in.  If replacements is negative, the number of
		 arguments in which to replace is unbounded.

	 -S replsize
		 Specify the amount of space (in bytes) that -I can use for
		 replacements.  The default for replsize is 255.

	 -s size, --max-chars=size
		 Set the maximum number of bytes for the command line length
		 provided to utility.  The sum of the length of the utility name,
		 the arguments passed to utility (including NULL terminators) and
		 the current environment will be less than or equal to this
		 number.  The current default value for size is ARG_MAX - 4096.

	 -t, --verbose
		 Echo the command to be executed to standard error immediately
		 before it is executed.

	 -x, --exit
		 Force xargs to terminate immediately if a command line containing
		 number arguments will not fit in the specified (or default)
		 command line length.

	 If utility is omitted, echo(1) is used.

	 Undefined behavior may occur if utility reads from the standard input.

	 If a command line cannot be assembled, or cannot be invoked, or if an
	 invocation of utility is terminated by a signal, or an invocation of
	 utility exits with a value of 255, the xargs utility stops processing
	 input and exits after all invocations of utility finish processing.



### yes

## NAME

	 yes – be repetitively affirmative


## SYNOPSIS

	 yes [expletive]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The yes utility outputs expletive, or, by default, “y”, forever.



### tar

## NAME

	 tar – manipulate tape archives


## SYNOPSIS

	 tar [bundled-flags ⟨args⟩] [⟨file⟩ | ⟨pattern⟩ ...]
	 tar {-c} [options] [files | directories]
	 tar {-r | -u} -f archive-file [options] [files | directories]
	 tar {-t | -x} [options] [patterns]


## DESCRIPTION

	 tar creates and manipulates streaming archive files.  This implementation
	 can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm, 7-zip, and ISO
	 9660 cdrom images and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, zip, 7-zip, and shar
	 archives.

	 The first synopsis form shows a “bundled” option word.  This usage is
	 provided for compatibility with historical implementations.  See
	 COMPATIBILITY below for details.

	 The other synopsis forms show the preferred usage.  The first option to
	 tar is a mode indicator from the following list:
	 -c      Create a new archive containing the specified items.  The long
		 option form is --create.
	 -r      Like -c, but new entries are appended to the archive.  Note that
		 this only works on uncompressed archives stored in regular files.
		 The -f option is required.  The long option form is --append.
	 -t      List archive contents to stdout.  The long option form is --list.
	 -u      Like -r, but new entries are added only if they have a
		 modification date newer than the corresponding entry in the
		 archive.  Note that this only works on uncompressed archives
		 stored in regular files.  The -f option is required.  The long
		 form is --update.
	 -x      Extract to disk from the archive.	If a file with the same name
		 appears more than once in the archive, each copy will be
		 extracted, with later copies overwriting (replacing) earlier
		 copies.  The long option form is --extract.

	 In -c, -r, or -u mode, each specified file or directory is added to the
	 archive in the order specified on the command line.  By default, the
	 contents of each directory are also archived.

	 In extract or list mode, the entire command line is read and parsed
	 before the archive is opened.  The pathnames or patterns on the command
	 line indicate which items in the archive should be processed.  Patterns
	 are shell-style globbing patterns as documented in tcsh(1).



### gzip

## NAME

	 gzip, gunzip, zcat – compression/decompression tool using Lempel-Ziv
	 coding (LZ77)


## SYNOPSIS

	 gzip [-cdfhkLlNnqrtVv] [-S suffix] file [file [...]]
	 gunzip [-cfhkLNqrtVv] [-S suffix] file [file [...]]
	 zcat [-fhV] file [file [...]]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The gzip program compresses and decompresses files using Lempel-Ziv
	 coding (LZ77).  If no files are specified, gzip will compress from
	 standard input, or decompress to standard output.	When in compression
	 mode, each file will be replaced with another file with the suffix, set
	 by the -S suffix option, added, if possible.

	 In decompression mode, each file will be checked for existence, as will
	 the file with the suffix added.  Each file argument must contain a
	 separate complete archive; when multiple files are indicated, each is
	 decompressed in turn.

	 In the case of gzcat the resulting data is then concatenated in the
	 manner of cat(1).

	 If invoked as gunzip then the -d option is enabled.  If invoked as zcat
	 or gzcat then both the -c and -d options are enabled.

	 This version of gzip is also capable of decompressing files compressed
	 using compress(1), bzip2(1), lzip, or xz(1).



### gunzip

### zip

## NAME

	   zip - package and compress (archive) files


## SYNOPSIS

	   zip [-aABcdDeEfFghjklLmoqrRSTuvVwXyz!@$] [--longoption ...] [-b path]
	   [-n suffixes] [-t date] [-tt date] [zipfile [file ...]] [-xi list]

	   zipcloak (see separate man page)

	   zipnote (see separate man page)

	   zipsplit (see separate man page)

	   Note:  Command line processing in zip has been changed to support long
	   options and handle all options and arguments more consistently.	Some
	   old command lines that depend on command line inconsistencies may no
	   longer work.


## DESCRIPTION

	   zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
	   OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn RISC
	   OS.  It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands tar(1) and
	   compress(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS
       systems).

       A companion program (unzip(1L)) unpacks zip archives.  The zip and
       unzip(1L) programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting
       most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can
       work with archives produced by zip (with some exceptions, notably
       streamed archives, but recent changes in the zip file standard may
       facilitate better compatibility).  zip version 3.0 is compatible with
       PKZIP 2.04 and also supports the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which
       allow archives as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB
       in some cases).	zip also now supports bzip2 compression if the bzip2
       library is included when zip is compiled.  Note that PKUNZIP 1.10
       cannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04 or zip_3.0. You must use
       PKUNZIP 2.04g or unzip_5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract them.

       See the EXAMPLES section at the bottom of this page for examples of
       some typical uses of zip.

       Large Archives and Zip64. zip automatically uses the Zip64 extensions
       when files larger than 4 GB are added to an archive, an archive
       containing Zip64 entries is updated (if the resulting archive still
       needs Zip64), the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the
       number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.	Zip64 is also
       used for archives streamed from standard input as the size of such
       archives are not known in advance, but the option -fz- can be used to
       force zip to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long as Zip64
       extensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5 compatible unzip,
       such as unzip_6.0 or later, to extract files using the Zip64
       extensions.

       In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard
       encryption, or split archives created with the pause option may not be
       compatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are used and PKZIP at the
       time of this writing does not support data descriptors (but recent
       changes in the PKWare published zip standard now include some support
       for the data descriptor format zip uses).


       Mac OS X.  Though previous Mac versions had their own zip port, zip
       supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features
       apply.  References to "MacOS" below generally refer to MacOS versions
       older than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X
       port, such as resource forks, is expected in the next zip release.


       For a brief help on zip and unzip, run each without specifying any
       parameters on the command line.




### unzip

## NAME

       unzip - list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP archive


## SYNOPSIS

       unzip [-Z] [-cflptTuvz[abjnoqsCDKLMUVWX$/:^]] file[.zip] [file(s) ...]
       [-x xfile(s) ...] [-d exdir]


## DESCRIPTION

       unzip will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive, commonly
       found on MS-DOS systems.  The default behavior (with no options) is to
       extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all
       files from the specified ZIP archive.  A companion program, zip(1L),
       creates ZIP archives; both programs are compatible with archives
	   created by PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but in many cases the
	   program options or default behaviors differ.



### df

## NAME

	 df – display free disk space


## SYNOPSIS

	 df [--libxo] [-b | -g | -H | -h | -k | -m | -P] [-acIilntY] [-,]
	[-T type] [file | filesystem ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The df utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on
	 the specified mounted file system or on the file system of which file is
	 a part.  By default block counts are displayed with an assumed block size
	 of 512 bytes.  If neither a file or a file system operand is specified,
	 statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed (subject to the -t
	 option below).

	 The following options are available:

	 --libxo
		 Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
		 and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details
		 on command line arguments.

	 -a      Show all mount points, including those that were mounted with the
		 MNT_IGNORE flag.  This is implied for file systems specified on
		 the command line.

	 -b      Explicitly use 512 byte blocks, overriding any BLOCKSIZE
		 specification from the environment.  This is the same as the -P
		 option.  The -k option overrides this option.

	 -c      Display a grand total.

	 -g      Use 1073741824 byte (1 Gibibyte) blocks rather than the default.
		 This overrides any BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.

	 -h      “Human-readable” output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kibibyte,
		 Mebibyte, Gibibyte, Tebibyte and Pebibyte (based on powers of
		 1024) in order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer.
		 This applies to the Size, Used, and Avail columns only; the iused
		 and ifree columns will be displayed in powers of 1000.

	 -H, --si
		 Same as -h but based on powers of 1000.

	 -I      Suppress inode counts.  See -i below.

	 -i      Include statistics on the number of free and used inodes.	In
		 conjunction with the -h or -H options, the number of inodes is
		 scaled by powers of 1000.	In case the filesystem has no inodes
		 then ‘-’ is displayed instead of the usage percentage.

		 This option is now the default to conform to Version 3 of the
		 Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv3”).  Use -I to suppress this
		 output.

	 -k      Use 1024 byte (1 Kibibyte) blocks rather than the default.  This
		 overrides the -P option and any BLOCKSIZE specification from the
		 environment.

	 -l      Select locally-mounted file system for display.  If used in
		 combination with the -T type option, file system types will be
		 added or excluded acccording to the parameters of that option.

	 -m      Use 1048576 byte (1 Mebibyte) blocks rather than the default.
		 This overrides any BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.

	 -n      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file
		 systems.  This option should be used if it is possible that one
		 or more file systems are in a state such that they will not be
		 able to provide statistics without a long delay.  When this
		 option is specified, df will not request new statistics from the
		 file systems, but will respond with the possibly stale statistics
		 that were previously obtained.

	 -P      Explicitly use 512 byte blocks, overriding any BLOCKSIZE
		 specification from the environment.  This is the same as the -b
		 option.  The -g and -k options override this option.  In
		 compatibility mode, this also suppresses inode counts.

	 -T type
		 Select file systems to display.  More than one type may be
		 specified in a comma separated list.  The list of file system
		 types can be prefixed with “no” to specify the file system types
		 for which action should not be taken.  If used in combination
		 with the -l option, the parameters of this option will modify the
		 list of locally-mounted file systems selected by the -l option.
		 For example, the df command:

		   df -T nonfs,mfs

		 lists all file systems except those of type NFS and MFS.  The
		 lsvfs(1) command can be used to find out the types of file
		 systems that are available on the system.

	 -t      If used with no arguments, this option is a no-op (macOS already
		 prints the total allocated-space figures).  If used with an
		 argument, it acts like -T, but this usage is deprecated and
		 should not be relied upon.

	 -Y      Include file system type.

	 -,      (Comma) Print sizes grouped and separated by thousands using the
		 non-monetary separator returned by localeconv(3), typically a
		 comma or period.  If no locale is set, or the locale does not
		 have a non-monetary separator, this option has no effect.



### du

## NAME

	 du – display disk usage statistics


## SYNOPSIS

	 du [-Aclnx] [-H | -L | -P] [-g | -h | -k | -m] [-a | -s | -d depth]
	[-B blocksize] [-I mask] [-t threshold] [file ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The du utility displays the file system block usage for each file
	 argument and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each
	 directory argument.  If no file is specified, the block usage of the
	 hierarchy rooted in the current directory is displayed.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -A      Display the apparent size instead of the disk usage.  This can be
		 helpful when operating on compressed volumes or sparse files.

	 -B blocksize
		 Calculate block counts in blocksize byte blocks.  This is
		 different from the -h, -k, -m, --si and -g options or setting
		 BLOCKSIZE and gives an estimate of how much space the examined
		 file hierarchy would require on a filesystem with the given
		 blocksize.  Unless in -A mode, blocksize is rounded up to the
		 next multiple of 512.

	 -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed, symbolic links
		 in file hierarchies are not followed.

	 -I mask
		 Ignore files and directories matching the specified mask.

	 -L      Symbolic links on the command line and in file hierarchies are
		 followed.

	 -P      No symbolic links are followed.  This is the default.

	 -a      Display an entry for each file in a file hierarchy.

	 -c      Display a grand total.

	 -d depth
		 Display an entry for all files and directories depth directories
		 deep.

	 -g      Display block counts in 1073741824-byte (1 GiB) blocks.

	 -h      “Human-readable” output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,
		 Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte based on powers of
		 1024.

	 -k      Display block counts in 1024-byte (1 kiB) blocks.

	 -l      If a file has multiple hard links, count its size multiple times.
		 The default behavior of du is to count files with multiple hard
		 links only once.  When the -l option is specified, the hard link
		 checks are disabled, and these files are counted (and displayed)
		 as many times as they are found.

	 -m      Display block counts in 1048576-byte (1 MiB) blocks.

	 -n      Ignore files and directories with user “nodump” flag (UF_NODUMP)
		 set.

	 -r      Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
		 that cannot be opened, and so on.	This is the default case.
		 This option exists solely for conformance with X/Open Portability
		 Guide Issue 4 (“XPG4”).

	 -s      Display an entry for each specified file.	(Equivalent to -d 0)

	 --si    “Human-readable” output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,
		 Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte based on powers of
		 1000.

	 -t threshold
		 Display only entries for which size exceeds threshold.  If
		 threshold is negative, display only entries for which size is
		 less than the absolute value of threshold.

	 -x      File system mount points are not traversed.

	 The du utility counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the
	 files they reference unless the -H or -L option is specified.  If either
	 the -H or -L option is specified, storage used by any symbolic links
	 which are followed is not counted (or displayed).	The -H, -L and -P
	 options override each other and the command's actions are determined by
     the last one specified.

     Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
     time per du execution.  Directories having multiple hard links (typically
     Time Machine backups) are counted a single time per du execution.	The
     -h, -k, -m and --si options all override each other; the last one
     specified determines the block counts used.



### free

## NAME

     calloc, free, malloc, realloc, reallocf, valloc, aligned_alloc – memory
     allocation


## SYNOPSIS

     #include <stdlib.h>

     void *
     calloc(size_t count, size_t size);

     void
     free(void *ptr);

     void *
     malloc(size_t size);

     void *
     realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

     void *
     reallocf(void *ptr, size_t size);

     void *
     valloc(size_t size);

     void *
     aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);


## DESCRIPTION

     The malloc(), calloc(), valloc(), realloc(), and reallocf() functions
     allocate memory.  The allocated memory is aligned such that it can be
     used for any data type, including AltiVec- and SSE-related types.	The
     aligned_alloc() function allocates memory with the requested alignment.
     The free() function frees allocations that were created via the preceding
     allocation functions.

     The malloc() function allocates size bytes of memory and returns a
     pointer to the allocated memory.

     The calloc() function contiguously allocates enough space for count
     objects that are size bytes of memory each and returns a pointer to the
     allocated memory.	The allocated memory is filled with bytes of value
     zero.

     The valloc() function allocates size bytes of memory and returns a
     pointer to the allocated memory.  The allocated memory is aligned on a
     page boundary.

     The aligned_alloc() function allocates size bytes of memory with an
     alignment specified by alignment and returns a pointer to the allocated
     memory.

     The realloc() function tries to change the size of the allocation pointed
     to by ptr to size, and returns ptr.  If there is not enough room to
     enlarge the memory allocation pointed to by ptr, realloc() creates a new
     allocation, copies as much of the old data pointed to by ptr as will fit
     to the new allocation, frees the old allocation, and returns a pointer to
     the allocated memory.  If ptr is NULL, realloc() is identical to a call
     to malloc() for size bytes.  If size is zero and ptr is not NULL, a new,
     minimum sized object is allocated and the original object is freed.  When
     extending a region allocated with calloc(3), realloc(3) does not
     guarantee that the additional memory is also zero-filled.

     The reallocf() function is identical to the realloc() function, except
     that it will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be
     allocated.  This is a FreeBSD specific API designed to ease the problems
     with traditional coding styles for realloc causing memory leaks in
     libraries.

     The free() function deallocates the memory allocation pointed to by ptr.
     If ptr is a NULL pointer, no operation is performed.



### uptime

## NAME

     uptime – show how long system has been running


## SYNOPSIS

     uptime


## DESCRIPTION

     The uptime utility displays the current time, the length of time the
     system has been up, the number of users, and the load average of the
     system over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.



### top

## NAME

     top – display sorted information about processes


## SYNOPSIS

     top [-a | -d | -e | -c mode]
	 [-F | -f]
	 [-h]
	 [-i interval]
	 [-l samples]
	 [-ncols columns]
	 [-o key | -O skey]
	 [-R | -r]
	 [-S]
	 [-s delay-secs]
	 [-n nprocs]
	 [-stats keys]
	 [-pid processid]
	 [-user username]
	 [-U username]
	 [-u]


## DESCRIPTION

     The top program periodically displays a sorted list of system processes.
     The default sorting key is pid, but other keys can be used instead.
     Various output options are available.



### ps

## NAME

     ps – process status


## SYNOPSIS

     ps [-AaCcEefhjlMmrSTvwXx] [-O fmt | -o fmt] [-G gid[,gid...]]
	[-g grp[,grp...]] [-u uid[,uid...]] [-p pid[,pid...]]
	[-t tty[,tty...]] [-U user[,user...]]
     ps [-L]


## DESCRIPTION

     The ps utility displays a header line, followed by lines containing
     information about all of your processes that have controlling terminals.

     A different set of processes can be selected for display by using any
     combination of the -a, -G, -g, -p, -T, -t, -U, and -u options.  If more
     than one of these options are given, then ps will select all processes
     which are matched by at least one of the given options.

     For the processes which have been selected for display, ps will usually
     display one line per process.  The -M option may result in multiple
     output lines (one line per thread) for some processes.  By default all of
     these output lines are sorted first by controlling terminal, then by
     process ID.  The -m, -r, and -v options will change the sort order.  If
     more than one sorting option was given, then the selected processes will
     be sorted by the last sorting option which was specified.

     For the processes which have been selected for display, the information
     to display is selected based on a set of keywords (see the -L, -O, and -o
     options).	The default output format includes, for each process, the
	 process' ID, controlling terminal, CPU time (including both user and
	 system time), state, and associated command.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -A      Display information about other users' processes, including those
	     without controlling terminals.

	 -a      Display information about other users' processes as well as your
		 own.  This will skip any processes which do not have a
		 controlling terminal, unless the -x option is also specified.

	 -C      Change the way the CPU percentage is calculated by using a “raw”
		 CPU calculation that ignores “resident” time (this normally has
		 no effect).

	 -c      Change the “command” column output to just contain the executable
		 name, rather than the full command line.

	 -d      Like -A, but excludes session leaders.

	 -E      Display the environment as well.  This does not reflect changes
		 in the environment after process launch.

	 -e      Identical to -A.

	 -f      Display the uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start
		 time, controlling tty, elapsed CPU usage, and the associated
		 command.  If the -u option is also used, display the user name
		 rather then the numeric uid.  When -o or -O is used to add to the
		 display following -f, the command field is not truncated as
		 severely as it is in other formats.

	 -G      Display information about processes which are running with the
		 specified real group IDs.

	 -g      Display information about processes with the specified process
		 group leaders.

	 -h      Repeat the information header as often as necessary to guarantee
		 one header per page of information.

	 -j      Print information associated with the following keywords: user,
		 pid, ppid, pgid, sess, jobc, state, tt, time, and command.

	 -L      List the set of keywords available for the -O and -o options.

	 -l      Display information associated with the following keywords: uid,
		 pid, ppid, flags, cpu, pri, nice, vsz=SZ, rss, wchan, state=S,
		 paddr=ADDR, tty, time, and command=CMD.

	 -M      Print the threads corresponding to each task.

	 -m      Sort by memory usage, instead of the combination of controlling
		 terminal and process ID.

	 -O      Add the information associated with the space or comma separated
		 list of keywords specified, after the process ID, in the default
		 information display.  Keywords may be appended with an equals
		 (‘=’) sign and a string.  This causes the printed header to use
		 the specified string instead of the standard header.

	 -o      Display information associated with the space or comma separated
		 list of keywords specified.  Multiple keywords may also be given
		 in the form of more than one -o option.  Keywords may be appended
		 with an equals (‘=’) sign and a string.  This causes the printed
		 header to use the specified string instead of the standard
		 header.  If all keywords have empty header texts, no header line
		 is written.

	 -p      Display information about processes which match the specified
		 process IDs.

	 -r      Sort by current CPU usage, instead of the combination of
		 controlling terminal and process ID.

	 -S      Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all
		 exited children to their parent process.

	 -T      Display information about processes attached to the device
		 associated with the standard input.

	 -t      Display information about processes attached to the specified
		 terminal devices.

	 -U      Display the processes belonging to the specified real user IDs.

	 -u      Display the processes belonging to the specified usernames.

	 -v      Display information associated with the following keywords: pid,
		 state, time, sl, re, pagein, vsz, rss, lim, tsiz, %cpu, %mem, and
		 command.  The -v option implies the -m option.

	 -w      Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default
		 which is your window size.  If the -w option is specified more
		 than once, ps will use as many columns as necessary without
		 regard for your window size.  When output is not to a terminal,
		 an unlimited number of columns are always used.

	 -X      When displaying processes matched by other options, skip any
		 processes which do not have a controlling terminal.

	 -x      When displaying processes matched by other options, include
		 processes which do not have a controlling terminal.  This is the
		 opposite of the -X option.  If both -X and -x are specified in
		 the same command, then ps will use the one which was specified
		 last.

	 A complete list of the available keywords is given below.	Some of these
	 keywords are further specified as follows:

	 %cpu      The CPU utilization of the process; this is a decaying average
		   over up to a minute of previous (real) time.  Because the time
		   base over which this is computed varies (some processes may be
		   very young), it is possible for the sum of all %cpu fields to
		   exceed 100%.

	 %mem      The percentage of real memory used by this process.

	 flags     The flags associated with the process as in the include file
		   <sys/proc.h>:

		   P_ADVLOCK	   0x00001	Process may hold a POSIX
						advisory lock
		   P_CONTROLT	   0x00002	Has a controlling terminal
		   P_LP64		   0x00004	Process is LP64
		   P_NOCLDSTOP	   0x00008	No SIGCHLD when children stop
		   P_PPWAIT 	   0x00010	Parent is waiting for child to
						exec/exit
		   P_PROFIL 	   0x00020	Has started profiling
		   P_SELECT 	   0x00040	Selecting; wakeup/waiting
						danger
		   P_CONTINUED	   0x00080	Process was stopped and
						continued
		   P_SUGID		   0x00100	Had set id privileges since
						last exec
		   P_SYSTEM 	   0x00200	System proc: no sigs, stats or
						swapping
		   P_TIMEOUT	   0x00400	Timing out during sleep
		   P_TRACED 	   0x00800	Debugged process being traced
		   P_WAITED 	   0x01000	Debugging process has waited
						for child
		   P_WEXIT		   0x02000	Working on exiting
		   P_EXEC		   0x04000	Process called exec
		   P_OWEUPC 	   0x08000	Owe process an addupc() call
						at next ast
		   P_WAITING	   0x40000	Process has a wait() in
						progress
		   P_KDEBUG 	   0x80000	  Kdebug tracing on for this
				   process

	 lim       The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
		   setrlimit(2).

	 lstart    The exact time the command started, using the ‘%c’ format
		   described in strftime(3).

	 nice      The process scheduling increment (see setpriority(2)).

	 rss       the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024
		   byte units).

	 start     The time the command started.  If the command started less than
		   24 hours ago, the start time is displayed using the “%l:ps.1p”
		   format described in strftime(3).  If the command started less
		   than 7 days ago, the start time is displayed using the
		   “%a6.15p” format.  Otherwise, the start time is displayed using
		   the “%e%b%y” format.

	 state     The state is given by a sequence of characters, for example,
		   “RWNA”.	The first character indicates the run state of the
		   process:

		   I       Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than
			   about 20 seconds).
		   R       Marks a runnable process.
		   S       Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20
			   seconds.
		   T       Marks a stopped process.
		   U       Marks a process in uninterruptible wait.
		   Z       Marks a dead process (a “zombie”).

		   Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional
		   state information:

		   +       The process is in the foreground process group of its
			   control terminal.
		   <       The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
		   >       The process has specified a soft limit on memory
			   requirements and is currently exceeding that limit;
			   such a process is (necessarily) not swapped.
		   A       the process has asked for random page replacement
			   (VA_ANOM, from vadvise(2), for example, lisp(1) in a
			   garbage collect).
		   E       The process is trying to exit.
		   L       The process has pages locked in core (for example, for
			   raw I/O).
		   N       The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see
			   setpriority(2)).
		   S       The process has asked for FIFO page replacement
			   (VA_SEQL, from vadvise(2), for example, a large image
			   processing program using virtual memory to sequentially
			   address voluminous data).
		   s       The process is a session leader.
		   V       The process is suspended during a vfork(2).
		   W       The process is swapped out.
		   X       The process is being traced or debugged.

	 tt        An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal,
		   if any.	The abbreviation consists of the three letters
		   following /dev/tty, or, for the console, “con”.	This is
		   followed by a ‘-’ if the process can no longer reach that
		   controlling terminal (i.e., it has been revoked).

	 wchan     The event (an address in the system) on which a process waits.
		   When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
		   trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, for example,
		   0x80324000 prints as 324000.

	 When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
	 has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a
	 zombie) is listed as “<defunct>”, and a process which is blocked while
	 trying to exit is listed as “<exiting>”.  If the arguments cannot be
	 located (usually because it has not been set, as is the case of system
	 processes and/or kernel threads) the command name is printed within
	 square brackets.  The process can change the arguments shown with
	 setproctitle(3).  Otherwise, ps makes an educated guess as to the file
	 name and arguments given when the process was created by examining memory
	 or the swap area.	The method is inherently somewhat unreliable and in
	 any event a process is entitled to destroy this information.  The ucomm
	 (accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.  If the arguments are
	 unavailable or do not agree with the ucomm keyword, the value for the
	 ucomm keyword is appended to the arguments in parentheses.



### kill

## NAME

	 kill – terminate or signal a process


## SYNOPSIS

	 kill [-s signal_name] pid ...
	 kill -l [exit_status]
	 kill -signal_name pid ...
	 kill -signal_number pid ...


## DESCRIPTION

	 The kill utility sends a signal to the processes specified by the pid
	 operands.

	 Only the super-user may send signals to other users' processes.

     The options are as follows:

     -s signal_name
	     A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead
	     of the default TERM.

     -l [exit_status]
	     If no operand is given, list the signal names; otherwise, write
	     the signal name corresponding to exit_status.

     -signal_name
	     A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead
	     of the default TERM.

     -signal_number
	     A non-negative decimal integer, specifying the signal to be sent
	     instead of the default TERM.

     The following PIDs have special meanings:

     -1      If superuser, broadcast the signal to all processes; otherwise
	     broadcast to all processes belonging to the user.

     Some of the more commonly used signals:

     1	     HUP (hang up)
     2	     INT (interrupt)
     3	     QUIT (quit)
     6	     ABRT (abort)
     9	     KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
     14      ALRM (alarm clock)
     15      TERM (software termination signal)

     Some shells may provide a builtin kill command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.



### killall

## NAME

     killall – kill processes by name


## SYNOPSIS

     killall [-delmsvqz] [-help] [-I] [-u user] [-t tty] [-c procname]
	     [-SIGNAL] [procname ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The killall utility kills processes selected by name, as opposed to the
     selection by PID as done by kill(1).  By default, it will send a TERM
     signal to all processes with a real UID identical to the caller of
     killall that match the name procname.  The super-user is allowed to kill
     any process.

     The options are as follows:

     -d 		Be more verbose about what will be done, but do not
			send any signal.  The total number of user processes
			and the real user ID is shown.	A list of the
			processes that will be sent the signal will be
			printed, or a message indicating that no matching
			processes have been found.

     -e 		Use the effective user ID instead of the (default)
			real user ID for matching processes specified with the
			-u option.

     -help		Give a help on the command usage and exit.

     -I 		Request confirmation before attempting to signal each
			process.

     -l 		List the names of the available signals and exit, like
			in kill(1).

     -m 		Match the argument procname as a (case sensitive)
			regular expression against the names of processes
			found.	CAUTION!  This is dangerous, a single dot will
			match any process running under the real UID of the
			caller.

     -v 		Be verbose about what will be done.

     -s 		Same as -v, but do not send any signal.

     -SIGNAL		Send a different signal instead of the default TERM.
			The signal may be specified either as a name (with or
			without a leading “SIG”), or numerically.

     -u user		Limit potentially matching processes to those
			belonging to the specified user.

     -t tty		Limit potentially matching processes to those running
			on the specified tty.

     -c procname	Limit potentially matching processes to those matching
			the specified procname.

     -q 		Suppress error message if no processes are matched.

     -z 		Do not skip zombies.  This should not have any effect
			except to print a few error messages if there are
			zombie processes that match the specified pattern.



### time

## NAME

     time – time command execution


## SYNOPSIS

     time [-al] [-h | -p] [-o file] utility [argument ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The time utility executes and times the specified utility.  After the
     utility finishes, time writes to the standard error stream, (in seconds):
     the total time elapsed, the time used to execute the utility process and
     the time consumed by system overhead.

     The following options are available:

     -a      If the -o flag is used, append to the specified file rather than
	     overwriting it.  Otherwise, this option has no effect.

     -h      Print times in a human friendly format.  Times are printed in
	     minutes, hours, etc. as appropriate.

     -l      The contents of the rusage structure are printed as well.

     -o file
	     Write the output to file instead of stderr.  If file exists and
	     the -a flag is not specified, the file will be overwritten.

     -p      Makes time output POSIX.2 compliant (each time is printed on its
	     own line).

     Some shells may provide a builtin time command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     If time receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal,
     the current time the given command is running will be written to the
     standard output.



### uname

## NAME

     uname – display information about the system


## SYNOPSIS

     uname [-amnoprsv]


## DESCRIPTION

     The uname command writes the name of the operating system implementation
     to standard output.  When options are specified, strings representing one
     or more system characteristics are written to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Behave as though the options -m, -n, -r, -s, and -v were
	     specified.

     -m      Write the type of the current hardware platform to standard
	     output.  (make(1) uses it to set the MACHINE variable.)

     -n      Write the name of the system to standard output.

     -o      This is a synonym for the -s option, for compatibility with other
	     systems.

     -p      Write the type of the machine processor architecture to standard
	     output.  (make(1) uses it to set the MACHINE_ARCH variable.)

     -r      Write the current release level of the operating system to
	     standard output.

     -s      Write the name of the operating system implementation to standard
	     output.

     -v      Write the version level of this release of the operating system
	     to standard output.

     If the -a flag is specified, or multiple flags are specified, all output
     is written on a single line, separated by spaces.



### hostname

## NAME

     hostname – set or print name of current host system


## SYNOPSIS

     hostname [-f] [-s | -d] [name-of-host]


## DESCRIPTION

     The hostname utility prints the name of the current host.	The super-user
     can set the hostname by supplying an argument.  To keep the hostname
     between reboots, run ‘scutil --set HostName name-of-host’.

     Options:

     -f    Include domain information in the printed name.  This is the
	   default behavior.

     -s    Trim off any domain information from the printed name.

     -d    Only print domain information.



### whoami

## NAME

     whoami – display effective user id


## SYNOPSIS

     whoami


## DESCRIPTION

     The whoami utility has been obsoleted by the id(1) utility, and is
     equivalent to “id -un”.  The command “id -p” is suggested for normal
     interactive use.

     The whoami utility displays your effective user ID as a name.



### who

## NAME

     who – display who is on the system


## SYNOPSIS

     who [-abHmqsTu] [am I] [file]


## DESCRIPTION

     The who utility displays information about currently logged in users.  By
     default, this includes the login name, tty name, date and time of login
     and remote hostname if not local.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Equivalent to -bTu, with the exception that output is not
	     restricted to the time and date of the last system reboot.

     -b      Write the time and date of the last system reboot.

     -H      Write column headings above the output.

     -m      Show information about the terminal attached to standard input
	     only.

     -q      “Quick mode”: List the names and number of logged in users in
	     columns.  All other command line options are ignored.

     -s      Show the name, line and time fields only.	This is the default.

     -T      Indicate whether each user is accepting messages.	One of the
	     following characters is written:

	     +	User is accepting messages.
	     -	User is not accepting messages.
	     ?	An error occurred.

     -u      Show idle time for each user in hours and minutes as hh:mm, ‘.’
	     if the user has been idle less than a minute, and “old” if the
	     user has been idle more than 24 hours.

     am I    Equivalent to -m.

     By default, who gathers information from the file /var/run/utmpx.	An
     alternate file may be specified which is usually /var/log/utx.log (or
     /var/log/utx.log.[0-6] depending on site policy as utx.log can grow quite
     large and daily versions may or may not be kept around after compression
     by ac(8)).  The utx.log file contains a record of every login, logout,
     crash, shutdown and date change since utx.log was last truncated or
     created.

     If /var/log/utx.log is being used as the file, the user name may be empty
	 or one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.  Logouts produce an
     output line without any user name.  For more information on the special
     characters, see getutxent(3).



### users

## NAME

     users – list current users


## SYNOPSIS

     users


## DESCRIPTION

     The users utility lists the login names of the users currently on the
     system, in sorted order, space separated, on a single line.



### id

## NAME

     id – return user identity


## SYNOPSIS

     id [user]
     id -A
     id -F [user]
     id -G [-n] [user]
     id -P [user]
     id -g [-nr] [user]
     id -p [user]
     id -u [-nr] [user]


## DESCRIPTION

     The id utility displays the user and group names and numeric IDs, of the
     calling process, to the standard output.  If the real and effective IDs
     are different, both are displayed, otherwise only the real ID is
     displayed.

     If a user (login name or user ID) is specified, the user and group IDs of
     that user are displayed.  In this case, the real and effective IDs are
     assumed to be the same.

     The options are as follows:

     -A      Display the process audit user ID and other process audit
	     properties, which requires privilege.

     -F      Display the full name of the user.

     -G      Display the different group IDs (effective, real and
	     supplementary) as white-space separated numbers, in no particular
	     order.

     -P      Display the id as a password file entry.

     -a      Ignored for compatibility with other id implementations.

     -g      Display the effective group ID as a number.

     -n      Display the name of the user or group ID for the -G, -g and -u
	     options instead of the number.  If any of the ID numbers cannot
	     be mapped into names, the number will be displayed as usual.

     -p      Make the output human-readable.  If the user name returned by
	     getlogin(2) is different from the login name referenced by the
	     user ID, the name returned by getlogin(2) is displayed, preceded
	     by the keyword “login”.  The user ID as a name is displayed,
	     preceded by the keyword “uid”.  If the effective user ID is
	     different from the real user ID, the real user ID is displayed as
	     a name, preceded by the keyword “euid”.  If the effective group
	     ID is different from the real group ID, the real group ID is
	     displayed as a name, preceded by the keyword “rgid”.  The list of
	     groups to which the user belongs is then displayed as names,
	     preceded by the keyword “groups”.	Each display is on a separate
	     line.

     -r      Display the real ID for the -g and -u options instead of the
	     effective ID.

     -u      Display the effective user ID as a number.



### groups

## NAME

     groups – show group memberships


## SYNOPSIS

     groups [user]


## DESCRIPTION

     The groups utility has been obsoleted by the id(1) utility, and is
     equivalent to “id -Gn [user]”.  The command “id -p” is suggested for
     normal interactive use.

     The groups utility displays the groups to which you (or the optionally
     specified user) belong.



### ping

## NAME

     ping – send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts


## SYNOPSIS

     ping [-AaCDdfnoQqRrv] [-b boundif] [-c count] [-G sweepmaxsize]
	  [-g sweepminsize] [-h sweepincrsize] [-i wait] [-k trafficclass]
	  [-K netservicetype] [-l preload] [-M mask | time] [-m ttl]
	  [-P policy] [-p pattern] [-S src_addr] [-s packetsize] [-t timeout]
	  [-W waittime] [-z tos] [--apple-connect] [--apple-time]
	  [--apple-print-id] [--apple-print-req] host
     ping [-AaDdfLnoQqRrv] [-b boundif] [-c count] [-I iface] [-i wait]
	  [-k trafficclass] [-K netservicetype] [-l preload] [-M mask | time]
	  [-m ttl] [-P policy] [-p pattern] [-S src_addr] [-s packetsize]
	  [-T ttl] [-t timeout] [-W waittime] [-z tos] [--apple-connect]
	  [--apple-time] [--apple-print-id] [--apple-print-req] mcast-group


## DESCRIPTION

	 The ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram
	 to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST
	 datagrams (“pings”) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a “struct
	 timeval” and then an arbitrary number of “pad” bytes used to fill out the
	 packet.  The options are as follows:

	 -A      Audible.  Output a bell (ASCII 0x07) character when no packet is
		 received before the next packet is transmitted.  To cater for
		 round-trip times that are longer than the interval between
		 transmissions, further missing packets cause a bell only if the
		 maximum number of unreceived packets has increased.

	 -a      Audible.  Include a bell (ASCII 0x07) character in the output
		 when any packet is received.  This option is ignored if other
		 format options are present.

	 -b boundif
		 Bind the socket to interface boundif for sending.	This option is
		 an Apple addition.

	 -C      Prohibit the socket from using the cellular network interface.
		 This option is an Apple addition.

	 -c count
		 Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
		 If this option is not specified, ping will operate until
		 interrupted.  If this option is specified in conjunction with
		 ping sweeps, each sweep will consist of count packets.

	 -D      Set the Don't Fragment bit.

     -d      Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

     -f      Flood ping.  Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one
	     hundred times per second, whichever is more.  For every
	     ECHO_REQUEST sent a period “.” is printed, while for every
	     ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed.  This provides a
	     rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.  Only the
	     super-user may use this option.  This can be very hard on a
	     network and should be used with caution.

     -G sweepmaxsize
	     Specify the maximum size of ICMP payload when sending sweeping
	     pings.  This option is required for ping sweeps.

     -g sweepminsize
	     Specify the size of ICMP payload to start with when sending
	     sweeping pings.  The default value is 0.

     -h sweepincrsize
	     Specify the number of bytes to increment the size of ICMP payload
	     after each sweep when sending sweeping pings.  The default value
	     is 1.

     -I iface
	     Source multicast packets with the given interface address.  This
	     flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -i wait
	     Wait wait seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to
	     wait for one second between each packet.  The wait time may be
	     fractional, but only the super-user may specify values less than
	     0.002 second.  This option is incompatible with the -f option.

     -k trafficclass
	     Specifies the traffic class to use for sending ICMP packets.  The
	     supported traffic classes are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RD, OAM, AV, RV,
	     VI, VO and CTL.  By default ping uses the control traffic class
	     (CTL).  This option is an Apple addition.

     -K netservicetype
	     Specifies the network service type to use for sending ICMP
	     packets.  The supported network service type are BK_SYS, BK, BE,
	     RV, AV, RD, OAM, VI, SIG and VO.  Note this overrides the default
	     traffic class (-k can still be specified after -K to use both).
	     This option is an Apple addition.

     -L      Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies
	     if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -l preload
	     If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as
	     possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.	Only
	     the super-user may use this option.

     -M mask | time
	     Use ICMP_MASKREQ or ICMP_TSTAMP instead of ICMP_ECHO.  For mask,
	     print the netmask of the remote machine.  Set the
	     net.inet.icmp.maskrepl MIB variable to enable ICMP_MASKREPLY.
	     For time, print the origination, reception and transmission
	     timestamps.

     -m ttl  Set the IP Time To Live for outgoing packets.  If not specified,
	     the kernel uses the value of the net.inet.ip.ttl MIB variable.

     -n      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
	     names for host addresses.

     -o      Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.

     -P policy
	     policy specifies IPsec policy for the ping session.  For details
	     please refer to ipsec(4) and ipsec_set_policy(3).

     -p pattern
	     You may specify up to 16 “pad” bytes to fill out the packet you
	     send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
	     network.  For example, “-p ff” will cause the sent packet to be
	     filled with all ones.

	 -Q      Somewhat quiet output.  Don't display ICMP error messages that
		 are in response to our query messages.  Originally, the -v flag
		 was required to display such errors, but -v displays all ICMP
		 error messages.  On a busy machine, this output can be
		 overbearing.  Without the -Q flag, ping prints out any ICMP error
		 messages caused by its own ECHO_REQUEST messages.

	 -q      Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at
		 startup time and when finished.

	 -R      Record route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the
		 ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on returned
		 packets.  This option is deprecated and is now a no-op.

	 -r      Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on
		 an attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached
		 network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping a
		 local host through an interface that has no route through it.

	 -S src_addr
		 Use the following IP address as the source address in outgoing
		 packets.  On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can
		 be used to force the source address to be something other than
		 the IP address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If
		 the IP address is not one of this machine's interface addresses,
	     an error is returned and nothing is sent.

     -s packetsize
	     Specify the number of data bytes to be sent.  The default is 56,
	     which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8
	     bytes of ICMP header data.  This option cannot be used with ping
	     sweeps.

     -T ttl  Set the IP Time To Live for multicasted packets.  This flag only
	     applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -t timeout
	     Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of
	     how many packets have been received.

     -v      Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are
	     received are listed.

     -W waittime
	     Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.
	     If a reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied,
	     but considered as replied when calculating statistics.

     -z tos  Use the specified type of service.

     --apple-connect
	     Connects the socket to the destination address.  This option is
	     an Apple addition.

     --apple-time
	     Prints the time a packet was received.  This option is an Apple
	     addition.

     --apple-print-id
	     Prints the ICMP echo ID.  This option is an Apple addition.

     --apple-print-req
	     Prints the ICMP echo request.  This option is an Apple addition.

     When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local
     host, to verify that the local network interface is up and running.
     Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be “pinged”.
     Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.	If duplicate
     packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss
     calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used in
     calculating the round-trip time statistics.  When the specified number of
     packets have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated
     with a SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed, showing the number of
     packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard
     deviation of the round-trip times.

     If ping receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal,
     the current number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean,
     and maximum of the round-trip times will be written to the standard error
     output.

     This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
     management.  Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is
     unwise to use ping during normal operations or from automated scripts.



### traceroute

## NAME

     traceroute – print the route packets take to network host


## SYNOPSIS

     traceroute [-adeEFISdNnrvx] [-A as_server] [-f first_ttl] [-g gateway]
		[-i iface] [-M first_ttl] [-m max_ttl] [-P proto] [-p port]
		[-q nqueries] [-s src_addr] [-t tos] [-w waittime]
		[-z pausemsecs] host [packetsize]


## DESCRIPTION

     The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware,
	 connected together by gateways.  Tracking the route one's packets follow
	 (or finding the miscreant gateway that's discarding your packets) can be
	 difficult.  traceroute utilizes the IP protocol `time to live' field and
	 attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along
	 the path to some host.

	 The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP number.
	 The default probe datagram length is 40 bytes, but this may be increased
	 by specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the destination host name.

	 TCP probes have no payload and the packetsize parameter is ignored for
	 TCP.

	 Other options are:

	 -a      Turn on AS# lookups for each hop encountered.

	 -A as_server
		 Turn  on  AS#  lookups  and  use the given server instead of the
		 default.

	 -d      Enable socket level debugging.

	 -D      When an ICMP response to our probe datagram is received, print
		 the differences between the transmitted packet and the packet
		 quoted by the ICMP response.  A key showing the location of
		 fields within the transmitted packet is printed, followed by the
		 original packet in hex, followed by the quoted packet in hex.
		 Bytes that are unchanged in the quoted packet are shown as
		 underscores.  Note, the IP checksum and the TTL of the quoted
		 packet are not expected to match.	By default, only one probe per
		 hop is sent with this option.

	 -E      Detect ECN bleaching.  Set the IPTOS_ECN_ECT1 bit and report if
		 that value has been bleached or mangled.

	 -e      Firewall evasion mode.  Use fixed destination ports for UDP and
		 TCP probes.  The destination port does NOT increment with each
		 packet sent.

	 -f first_ttl
		 Set the initial time-to-live used in the first outgoing probe
		 packet.

	 -F      Set the "don't fragment" bit.

	 -g gateway
		 Specify a loose source route gateway (8 maximum).

	 -i iface
		 Specify a network interface to obtain the source IP address for
		 outgoing probe packets. This is normally only useful on a multi-
		 homed host. (See the -s flag for another way to do this.)

	 -I      Use ICMP ECHO instead of UDP datagrams.  (A synonym for "-P
		 icmp").

	 -M first_ttl
		 Set the initial time-to-live value used in outgoing probe
		 packets.  The default is 1, i.e., start with the first hop.

	 -m max_ttl
		 Set the max time-to-live (max number of hops) used in outgoing
		 probe packets.  The default is net.inet.ip.ttl hops (the same
		 default used for TCP connections).

	 -n      Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and
		 numerically (saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each
		 gateway found on the path).

	 -P proto
		 Send packets of specified IP protocol. The currently supported
		 protocols are: UDP , TCP , GRE and ICMP Other protocols may also
		 be specified (either by name or by number), though traceroute
		 does not implement any special knowledge of their packet formats.
		 This option is useful for determining which router along a path
		 may be blocking packets based on IP protocol number. But see BUGS
		 below.

	 -p port
		 Protocol specific. For UDP and TCP, sets the base port number
		 used in probes (default is 33434).  traceroute hopes that nothing
		 is listening on UDP ports base to base+nhops-1 at the destination
		 host (so an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message will be returned to
		 terminate the route tracing).  If something is listening on a
		 port in the default range, this option can be used to pick an
		 unused port range.

	 -q nqueries
		 Set the number of probes per ``ttl'' to nqueries (default is
		 three probes).

	 -r      Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on
		 an attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached
		 network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping a
		 local host through an interface that has no route through it.

	 -s src_addr
		 Use the following IP address (which must be given as an IP
		 number, not a hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe
		 packets.  On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can
		 be used to force the source address to be something other than
		 the IP address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If
		 the IP address is not one of this machine's interface addresses,
	     an error is returned and nothing is sent.	(See the -i flag for
	     another way to do this.)

     -S      Print a summary of how many probes were not answered for each
	     hop.

     -t tos  Set the type-of-service in probe packets to the following value
	     (default zero).  The value must be a decimal integer in the range
	     0 to 255.	This option can be used to see if different types-of-
	     service result in different paths.  (If you are not running a
	     4.4BSD or later system, this may be academic since the normal
		 network services like telnet and ftp don't let you control the
		 TOS).  Not all values of TOS are legal or meaningful - see the IP
		 spec for definitions.  Useful values are probably ‘-t 16’ (low
		 delay) and ‘-t 8’ (high throughput).

	 -v      Verbose output.  Received ICMP packets other than TIME_EXCEEDED
		 and UNREACHABLEs are listed.

	 -w      Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe
		 (default 5 sec.).

	 -x      Toggle IP checksums. Normally, this prevents traceroute from
		 calculating IP checksums. In some cases, the operating system can
		 overwrite parts of the outgoing packet but not recalculate the
		 checksum (so in some cases the default is to not calculate
		 checksums and using -x causes them to be calculated). Note that
		 checksums are usually required for the last hop when using ICMP
		 ECHO probes ( -I ). So they are always calculated when using
		 ICMP.

	 -z pausemsecs
		 Set the time (in milliseconds) to pause between probes (default
		 0).  Some systems such as Solaris and routers such as Ciscos rate
		 limit ICMP messages. A good value to use with this is 500 (e.g.
		 1/2 second).

	 This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow to
	 some internet host by launching UDP probe packets with a small ttl (time
	 to live) then listening for an ICMP "time exceeded" reply from a gateway.
	 We start our probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an
	 ICMP "port unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max
	 (which defaults to net.inet.ip.ttl hops & can be changed with the -m
	 flag).  Three probes (changed with -q flag) are sent at each ttl setting
	 and a line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and round
	 trip time of each probe.  If the probe answers come from different
	 gateways, the address of each responding system will be printed.  If
	 there is no response within a 5 sec. timeout interval (changed with the
	 -w flag), a "*" is printed for that probe.

	 We don't want the destination host to process the UDP probe packets so
     the destination port is set to an unlikely value (if some clod on the
     destination is using that value, it can be changed with the -p flag).

     A sample use and output might be:

     [yak 71]% traceroute nis.nsf.net.

     Note that lines 2 & 3 are the same.  This is due to a buggy kernel on the
     2nd hop system - lbl-csam.arpa - that forwards packets with a zero ttl (a
     bug in the distributed version of 4.3 BSD).  Note that you have to guess
     what path the packets are taking cross-country since the NSFNet (129.140)
	 doesn't supply address-to-name translations for its NSSes.

	 Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 & 17 hops away either don't send
     ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them with a ttl too small to reach
	 us.  14 - 17 are running the MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time
	 exceeded"s.  God only knows what's going on with 12.

     The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in the
     4.[23] BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3) sends an
     unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the original datagram.
     Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is zero, the ICMP "time exceeded"
     is guaranteed to not make it back to us.  The behavior of this bug is
     slightly more interesting when it appears on the destination system:

     Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final destination) and
	 exactly the last half of them are "missing".  What's really happening is
	 that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5) is using the ttl from our arriving
	 datagram as the ttl in its ICMP reply.  So, the reply will time out on
	 the return path (with no notice sent to anyone since ICMP's aren't sent
	 for ICMP's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path
	 length.  I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.  A reply that returns with
	 a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.	traceroute prints a "!" after
	 the time if the ttl is <= 1.  Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete (DEC´s
	 Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or non-standard (HPUX) software, expect to see this
	 problem frequently and/or take care picking the target host of your
	 probes.

	 Other possible annotations after the time are !H, !N, or !P (host,
	 network or protocol unreachable), !S (source route failed),
	 (fragmentation needed - the RFC1191 Path MTU Discovery value is
	 displayed), !U or !W (destination network/host unknown), !I (source host
	 is isolated), !A (communication with destination network administratively
	 prohibited), !Z (communication with destination host administratively
	 prohibited), !Q (for this ToS the destination network is unreachable), !T
	 (for this ToS the destination host is unreachable), !X (communication
	 administratively prohibited), !V (host precedence violation), !C
	 (precedence cutoff in effect), or !<num> (ICMP unreachable code <num>).
	 These are defined by RFC1812 (which supersedes RFC1716).  If almost all
	 the probes result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute will give up
	 and exit.

	 This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
	 management.  It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
	 Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to use
	 traceroute during normal operations or from automated scripts.



### curl

## NAME

	   curl - transfer a URL


## SYNOPSIS

	   curl [options / URLs]


## DESCRIPTION

	   curl is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs. It
	   supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP,
	   HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP,
	   SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.

	   curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See
	   libcurl(3) for details.



### wget

## NAME

	   Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.


## SYNOPSIS

	   wget [option]... [URL]...


## DESCRIPTION

	   GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
	   the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
	   retrieval through HTTP proxies.

	   Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
	   while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
	   and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
	   contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
       which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local
       versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure
       of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive
       downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
       Standard (/robots.txt).	Wget can be instructed to convert the links in
       downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.

       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
       connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep
       retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
       supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
       download from where it left off.



### ftp

## NAME

       ftp - Client-side tcl implementation of the ftp protocol


## SYNOPSIS

       ::ftp::Quote handle arg1 arg2 ...

       ::ftp::DisplayMsg handle msg ?state?

______________________________________________________________________________


## DESCRIPTION

       The ftp package provides the client side of the ftp protocol as
       specified in RFC 959 (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc959.txt).  The
       package implements both active (default) and passive ftp sessions.

       A new ftp session is started with the ::ftp::Open command. To shutdown
       an existing ftp session use ::ftp::Close. All other commands are
       restricted to usage in an an open ftp session. They will generate
       errors if they are used out of context.	The ftp package includes file
       and directory manipulating commands for remote sites. To perform the
       same operations on the local site use commands built into the core,
       like cd or file.

       The output of the package is controlled by two state variables,
       ::ftp::VERBOSE and ::ftp::DEBUG. Setting ::ftp::VERBOSE to "1" forces
       the package to show all responses from a remote server. The default
       value is "0". Setting ::ftp::DEBUG to "1" enables debugging and forces
       the package to show all return codes, states, state changes and "real"
       ftp commands. The default value is "0".

       The command ::ftp::DisplayMsg is used to show the different messages
       from the ftp session. The setting of ::ftp::VERBOSE determines if this
       command is called or not. The current implementation of the command
       uses the log package of tcllib to write the messages to their final
       destination. This means that the behaviour of ::ftp::DisplayMsg can be
       customized without changing its implementation. For more radical
       changes overwriting its implementation by the application is of course
       still possible. Note that the default implementation honors the option
       -output to ::ftp::Open for a session specific log command.

       Caution: The default implementation logs error messages like all other
       messages. If this behaviour is changed to throwing an error instead all
       commands in the API will change their behaviour too. In such a case
       they will not return a failure code as described below but pass the
       thrown error to their caller.



### ssh

## NAME

     ssh – OpenSSH remote login client


## SYNOPSIS

     ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address]
	 [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file]
	 [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
	 [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
	 [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-P tag] [-p port] [-R address]
	 [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] destination
	 [command [argument ...]]
     ssh [-Q query_option]


## DESCRIPTION

     ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for
     executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure
     encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure
     network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets
     can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be
     specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form
     ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity to the
     remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

     If a command is specified, it will be executed on the remote host instead
     of a login shell.	A complete command line may be specified as command,
     or it may have additional arguments.  If supplied, the arguments will be
     appended to the command, separated by spaces, before it is sent to the
     server to be executed.

     The options are as follows:

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent
	     such as ssh-agent(1).  This can also be specified on a per-host
	     basis in a configuration file.

	     Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
	     ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
		 agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through
		 the forwarded connection.	An attacker cannot obtain key material
		 from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys
		 that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
		 the agent.  A safer alternative may be to use a jump host (see
		 -J).

	 -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

	 -B bind_interface
		 Bind to the address of bind_interface before attempting to
		 connect to the destination host.  This is only useful on systems
		 with more than one address.

	 -b bind_address
		 Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of
		 the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one
		 address.

	 -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
		 stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain
		 connections).  The compression algorithm is the same used by
		 gzip(1).  Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow
		 connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.
		 The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the
		 configuration files; see the Compression option in ssh_config(5).

	 -c cipher_spec
		 Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.
		 cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed in order
		 of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword in ssh_config(5) for more
		 information.

	 -D [bind_address:]port
		 Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.
		 This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
		 side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
		 connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
		 the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
		 determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
		 the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
		 as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
		 Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the
		 configuration file.

		 IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
		 square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
		 ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
		 the GatewayPorts setting.	However, an explicit bind_address may
		 be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
		 bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
		 bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
		 that the port should be available from all interfaces.

	 -E log_file
		 Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

	 -e escape_char
		 Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
		 The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
		 line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
		 connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and
		 followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
		 character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session
		 fully transparent.

	 -F configfile
		 Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a
		 configuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide
		 configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.	The
		 default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.  If
		 set to “none”, no configuration files will be read.

	 -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
		 This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
		 passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
		 implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
		 remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

		 If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to “yes”,
		 then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port
		 forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in
		 the background.  Refer to the description of
		 ForkAfterAuthentication in ssh_config(5) for details.

	 -G      Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and
		 Match blocks and exit.

	 -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.  If used
		 on a multiplexed connection, then this option must be specified
		 on the master process.

	 -I pkcs11
		 Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate
		 with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user authentication.  Use
		 of this option will disable UseKeychain.

	 -i identity_file
		 Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public
		 key authentication is read.  You can also specify a public key
		 file to use the corresponding private key that is loaded in
		 ssh-agent(1) when the private key file is not present locally.
		 The default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
		 ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.
		 Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
		 configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i options
		 (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  If
		 no certificates have been explicitly specified by the
		 CertificateFile directive, ssh will also try to load certificate
		 information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to
		 identity filenames.

	 -J destination
		 Connect to the target host by first making an ssh connection to
		 the jump host described by destination and then establishing a
		 TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple
		 jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.	IPv6
		 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square
		 brackets.	This is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump
		 configuration directive.  Note that configuration directives
		 supplied on the command-line generally apply to the destination
		 host and not any specified jump hosts.  Use ~/.ssh/config to
		 specify configuration for jump hosts.

	 -K      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)
		 of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

	 -k      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
		 server.

	 -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
	 -L [bind_address:]port:remote_socket
	 -L local_socket:host:hostport
	 -L local_socket:remote_socket
		 Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket
		 on the local (client) host are to be forwarded to the given host
		 and port, or Unix socket, on the remote side.  This works by
		 allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP port on the local
		 side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address, or to a
		 Unix socket.  Whenever a connection is made to the local port or
		 socket, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and
		 a connection is made to either host port hostport, or the Unix
		 socket remote_socket, from the remote machine.

		 Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.
		 Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  IPv6 addresses
		 can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.

		 By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
		 GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be
		 used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
		 bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
		 bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
		 that the port should be available from all interfaces.

	 -l login_name
		 Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also
		 may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.

	 -M      Places the ssh client into “master” mode for connection sharing.
		 Multiple -M options places ssh into “master” mode but with
		 confirmation required using ssh-askpass(1) before each operation
		 that changes the multiplexing state (e.g. opening a new session).
		 Refer to the description of ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for
		 details.

	 -m mac_spec
		 A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code)
		 algorithms, specified in order of preference.  See the MACs
		 keyword in ssh_config(5) for more information.

	 -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just
		 forwarding ports.	Refer to the description of SessionType in
		 ssh_config(5) for details.

	 -n      Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
		 stdin).  This must be used when ssh is run in the background.  A
		 common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote
		 machine.  For example, ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs & will
		 start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will
		 be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The ssh
		 program will be put in the background.  (This does not work if
		 ssh needs to ask for a password or passphrase; see also the -f
		 option.)  Refer to the description of StdinNull in ssh_config(5)
		 for details.

	 -O ctl_cmd
		 Control an active connection multiplexing master process.	When
		 the -O option is specified, the ctl_cmd argument is interpreted
		 and passed to the master process.	Valid commands are: “check”
		 (check that the master process is running), “forward” (request
		 forwardings without command execution), “cancel” (cancel
		 forwardings), “proxy” (connect to a running multiplexing master
		 in proxy mode), “exit” (request the master to exit), and “stop”
		 (request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing
		 requests).

	 -o option
		 Can be used to give options in the format used in the
		 configuration file.  This is useful for specifying options for
		 which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full details
		 of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
		 ssh_config(5).

	 -P tag  Specify a tag name that may be used to select configuration in
		 ssh_config(5).  Refer to the Tag and Match keywords in
		 ssh_config(5) for more information.
	 -p port
		 Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on
		 a per-host basis in the configuration file.

	 -Q query_option
		 Queries for the algorithms supported by one of the following
		 features: cipher (supported symmetric ciphers), cipher-auth
		 (supported symmetric ciphers that support authenticated
		 encryption), help (supported query terms for use with the -Q
		 flag), mac (supported message integrity codes), kex (key exchange

		 algorithms for certificates), key-cert (certificate key types),
		 key-plain (non-certificate key types), key-sig (all key types and
		 signature algorithms), protocol-version (supported SSH protocol
		 versions), and sig (supported signature algorithms).
		 Alternatively, any keyword from ssh_config(5) or sshd_config(5)
		 that takes an algorithm list may be used as an alias for the
		 corresponding query_option.

	 -q      Quiet mode.  Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be
		 suppressed.

	 -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
	 -R [bind_address:]port:local_socket
	 -R remote_socket:host:hostport
	 -R remote_socket:local_socket
	 -R [bind_address:]port
		 Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket
		 on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded to the local
		 side.

		 This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP port
		 or to a Unix socket on the remote side.  Whenever a connection is
		 made to this port or Unix socket, the connection is forwarded
		 over the secure channel, and a connection is made from the local
		 machine to either an explicit destination specified by host port
		 hostport, or local_socket, or, if no explicit destination was
		 specified, ssh will act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy and forward
		 connections to the destinations requested by the remote SOCKS
		 client.

		 Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.
		 Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on
		 the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
		 the address in square brackets.

		 By default, TCP listening sockets on the server will be bound to
		 the loopback interface only.  This may be overridden by
		 specifying a bind_address.  An empty bind_address, or the address
		 ‘*’, indicates that the remote socket should listen on all
		 interfaces.  Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed
		 if the server's GatewayPorts option is enabled (see
	     sshd_config(5)).

	     If the port argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically
	     allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.
	     When used together with -O forward, the allocated port will be
	     printed to the standard output.

     -S ctl_path
	     Specifies the location of a control socket for connection
	     sharing, or the string “none” to disable connection sharing.
	     Refer to the description of ControlPath and ControlMaster in
	     ssh_config(5) for details.

     -s      May be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote
	     system.  Subsystems facilitate the use of SSH as a secure
	     transport for other applications (e.g. sftp(1)).  The subsystem
	     is specified as the remote command.  Refer to the description of
	     SessionType in ssh_config(5) for details.

     -T      Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

     -t      Force pseudo-terminal allocation.	This can be used to execute
	     arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be
	     very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple -t
	     options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

     -V      Display the version number and exit.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh to print debugging messages about its
	     progress.	This is helpful in debugging connection,
	     authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple -v options
	     increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

     -W host:port
	     Requests that standard input and output on the client be
	     forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.  Implies -N,
	     -T, ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings, though these
	     can be overridden in the configuration file or using -o command
	     line options.

     -w local_tun[:remote_tun]
	     Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4)
	     devices between the client (local_tun) and the server
	     (remote_tun).

	     The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword
	     “any”, which uses the next available tunnel device.  If
	     remote_tun is not specified, it defaults to “any”.  See also the
	     Tunnel and TunnelDevice directives in ssh_config(5).

	     If the Tunnel directive is unset, it will be set to the default
	     tunnel mode, which is “point-to-point”.  If a different Tunnel
	     forwarding mode it desired, then it should be specified before
	     -w.

     -X      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host
	     basis in a configuration file.

	     X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
	     ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
		 user's X authorization database) can access the local X11 display
		 through the forwarded connection.	An attacker may then be able
		 to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.

		 For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY
		 extension restrictions by default.  Refer to the ssh -Y option
		 and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more
		 information.

	 -x      Disables X11 forwarding.

	 -Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not
		 subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.

	 -y      Send log information using the syslog(3) system module.  By
		 default this information is sent to stderr.

	 ssh may additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user
	 configuration file and a system-wide configuration file.  The file format
	 and configuration options are described in ssh_config(5).



### scp

## NAME

	 scp – OpenSSH secure file copy


## SYNOPSIS

	 scp [-346ABCOpqRrsTv] [-c cipher] [-D sftp_server_path] [-F ssh_config]
	 [-i identity_file] [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option]
	 [-P port] [-S program] [-X sftp_option] source ... target


## DESCRIPTION

	 scp copies files between hosts on a network.

	 scp uses the SFTP protocol over a ssh(1) connection for data transfer,
	 and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as a
	 login session.

	 scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
	 authentication.

	 The source and target may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host
	 with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a URI in the form
	 scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made explicit
	 using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names
	 containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.

	 When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a port
	 cannot be specified on the target if the -R option is used.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -3      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local
		 host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between
		 the two remote hosts.  Note that, when using the legacy SCP
		 protocol (via the -O flag), this option selects batch mode for
		 the second host as scp cannot ask for passwords or passphrases
		 for both hosts.  This mode is the default.

	 -4      Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.

	 -6      Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.

	 -A      Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.  The
		 default is not to forward an authentication agent.

	 -B      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
		 passphrases).

	 -C      Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable
		 compression.

	 -c cipher
		 Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
		 option is directly passed to ssh(1).

	 -D sftp_server_path
		 Connect directly to a local SFTP server program rather than a
		 remote one via ssh(1).  This option may be useful in debugging
		 the client and server.

	 -F ssh_config
		 Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh.
		 This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

	 -i identity_file
		 Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
		 key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
		 ssh(1).

	 -J destination
		 Connect to the target host by first making an scp connection to
		 the jump host described by destination and then establishing a
		 TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple
		 jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.	This
		 is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.
		 This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

	 -l limit
		 Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

	 -O      Use the legacy SCP protocol for file transfers instead of the
		 SFTP protocol.  Forcing the use of the SCP protocol may be
		 necessary for servers that do not implement SFTP, for backwards-
		 compatibility for particular filename wildcard patterns and for
		 expanding paths with a ‘~’ prefix for older SFTP servers.

	 -o ssh_option
		 Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in
		 ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
		 there is no separate scp command-line flag.  For full details of
		 the options listed below, and their possible values, see
		 ssh_config(5).

	 -P port
		 Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
		 this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because -p is already
		 reserved for preserving the times and mode bits of the file.

	 -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and file mode bits
		 from the source file.

	 -q      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
		 diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

	 -R      Copies between two remote hosts are performed by connecting to
		 the origin host and executing scp there.  This requires that scp
		 running on the origin host can authenticate to the destination
		 host without requiring a password.

	 -r      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that scp follows
		 symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

	 -S program
		 Name of program to use for the encrypted connection.  The program
		 must understand ssh(1) options.

	 -T      Disable strict filename checking.	By default when copying files
		 from a remote host to a local directory scp checks that the
		 received filenames match those requested on the command-line to
		 prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or unwanted files.
		 Because of differences in how various operating systems and
		 shells interpret filename wildcards, these checks may cause
		 wanted files to be rejected.  This option disables these checks
		 at the expense of fully trusting that the server will not send
		 unexpected filenames.

	 -v      Verbose mode.  Causes scp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages
		 about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
		 authentication, and configuration problems.

	 -X sftp_option
		 Specify an option that controls aspects of SFTP protocol
		 behaviour.  The valid options are:

		 nrequests=value
			 Controls how many concurrent SFTP read or write requests
			 may be in progress at any point in time during a download
			 or upload.  By default 64 requests may be active
			 concurrently.

		 buffer=value
			 Controls the maximum buffer size for a single SFTP
			 read/write operation used during download or upload.  By
			 default a 32KB buffer is used.



### sftp

## NAME

	 sftp – OpenSSH secure file transfer


## SYNOPSIS

	 sftp [-46AaCfNpqrv] [-B buffer_size] [-b batchfile] [-c cipher]
	  [-D sftp_server_command] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
	  [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port]
	  [-R num_requests] [-S program] [-s subsystem | sftp_server]
	  [-X sftp_option] destination


## DESCRIPTION

	 sftp is a file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which performs all
	 operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also use many
	 features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compression.

	 The destination may be specified either as [user@]host[:path] or as a URI
	 in the form sftp://[user@]host[:port][/path].

	 If the destination includes a path and it is not a directory, sftp will
	 retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method
	 is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive
	 authentication.

	 If no path is specified, or if the path is a directory, sftp will log in
	 to the specified host and enter interactive command mode, changing to the
	 remote directory if one was specified.  An optional trailing slash can be
	 used to force the path to be interpreted as a directory.

	 Since the destination formats use colon characters to delimit host names
	 from path names or port numbers, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in
	 square brackets to avoid ambiguity.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -4      Forces sftp to use IPv4 addresses only.

	 -6      Forces sftp to use IPv6 addresses only.

	 -A      Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.  The
		 default is not to forward an authentication agent.

	 -a      Attempt to continue interrupted transfers rather than overwriting
		 existing partial or complete copies of files.  If the partial
		 contents differ from those being transferred, then the resultant
		 file is likely to be corrupt.

	 -B buffer_size
		 Specify the size of the buffer that sftp uses when transferring
		 files.  Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of
		 higher memory consumption.  The default is 32768 bytes.

	 -b batchfile
		 Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile
		 instead of stdin.	Since it lacks user interaction, it should be
		 used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication to
		 obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see
		 sshd(8) and ssh-keygen(1) for details).

		 A batchfile of ‘-’ may be used to indicate standard input.  sftp
		 will abort if any of the following commands fail: get, put,
		 reget, reput, rename, ln, rm, mkdir, chdir, ls, lchdir, copy, cp,
		 chmod, chown, chgrp, lpwd, df, symlink, and lmkdir.

		 Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by command
		 basis by prefixing the command with a ‘-’ character (for example,
		 -rm /tmp/blah*).  Echo of the command may be suppressed by
		 prefixing the command with a ‘@’ character.  These two prefixes
		 may be combined in any order, for example -@ls /bsd.

	 -C      Enables compression (via ssh's -C flag).

     -c cipher
	     Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers.
	     This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -D sftp_server_command
	     Connect directly to a local sftp server (rather than via ssh(1)).
	     A command and arguments may be specified, for example
	     "/path/sftp-server -el debug3".  This option may be useful in
	     debugging the client and server.

     -F ssh_config
	     Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh(1).
	     This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -f      Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after
	     transfer.	When uploading files, this feature is only enabled if
	     the server implements the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.

     -i identity_file
	     Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
	     key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
	     ssh(1).

     -J destination
	     Connect to the target host by first making an sftp connection to
	     the jump host described by destination and then establishing a
	     TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple
	     jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.	This
	     is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.
	     This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -l limit
	     Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     -N      Disables quiet mode, e.g. to override the implicit quiet mode set
	     by the -b flag.

     -o ssh_option
	     Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in
	     ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
	     there is no separate sftp command-line flag.  For example, to
	     specify an alternate port use: sftp -oPort=24.  For full details
	     of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
	     ssh_config(5).

     -P port
	     Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.

     -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
	     original files transferred.

     -q      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
	     diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     -R num_requests
	     Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time.
	     Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed but will
	     increase memory usage.  The default is 64 outstanding requests.

     -r      Recursively copy entire directories when uploading and
	     downloading.  Note that sftp does not follow symbolic links
	     encountered in the tree traversal.

     -S program
	     Name of the program to use for the encrypted connection.  The
	     program must understand ssh(1) options.

     -s subsystem | sftp_server
	     Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server on
	     the remote host.  A path is useful when the remote sshd(8) does
	     not have an sftp subsystem configured.

     -v      Raise logging level.  This option is also passed to ssh.

     -X sftp_option
	     Specify an option that controls aspects of SFTP protocol
	     behaviour.  The valid options are:

	     nrequests=value
		     Controls how many concurrent SFTP read or write requests
		     may be in progress at any point in time during a download

	     buffer=value
		     Controls the maximum buffer size for a single SFTP
		     read/write operation used during download or upload.  By
		     default a 32KB buffer is used.



### mount

## NAME

     mount – mount file systems


## SYNOPSIS

     mount [-adfFrkuvw] [-t lfs | external_type]
     mount [-dfFrkuvw] special | mount_point
     mount [-dfFrkuvw] [-o options] [-t lfs | external_type]
	   special mount_point


## DESCRIPTION

     The mount command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a
     special device or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree
     at the point mount_point, which must be a directory.  If either special
     or mount_point are not provided, the appropriate information is obtained
     via the getfsent(3) library routines.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no
     arguments are given to mount, this list is printed.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      All the filesystems listed via getfsent(3) are mounted.
		 Exceptions are those marked as ``noauto;'' excluded by the -t
		 flag (see below); entries that are neither ``ro,'' ``rw,'' or
		 ``rq;'' ``nfs'' entries that also have ``net'' as an option; and
		 already-mounted ``nfs'' entries.

     -d      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.
	     This option is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to
	     determine what the mount command is trying to do.

     -f      Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a
	     filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.

     -F      Forces the file system type be considered as an FSModule
	     delivered using FSKit.

     -k      In the course of the mount system call, the kernel should not
	     follow any symlinks that may be present in the provided mount-on
	     directory.


     -o      Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma
	     separated string of options.  The following options are
	     available:

	     async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
		     This can be somewhat dangerous with respect to losing
		     data when faced with system crashes and power outages.
		     This is also the default.	It can be avoided with the
		     noasync option.

	     force   The same as -f; forces the revocation of write access
		     when trying to downgrade a filesystem mount status from
		     read-write to read-only.

	     noasync
		     This filesystem should not force all I/O to be written
		     asynchronously.

	     noauto  This filesystem should be skipped when mount is run with
		     the -a flag.

	     nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
		     the file system.  This option is useful for a server that
		     has file systems containing special devices for
		     architectures other than its own.

	     noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
		     file system.  This option is useful for a server that has
		     file systems containing binaries for architectures other
		     than its own.

	     noowners
		     Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.	This
		     causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and
		     group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current
		     effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and
			 translates to ``unknown''.

	     nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
		     bits to take effect.

	     rdonly  The same as -r; mount the file system read-only (even the
		     super-user may not write it).

	     sync    All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

	     update  The same as -u; indicate that the status of an already
		     mounted file system should be changed.

	     union   Causes the namespace to appear as the union of
		     directories of the mounted filesystem with corresponding
		     directories in the underlying filesystem.	Lookups will
		     be done in the mounted filesystem first.  If those
		     operations fail due to a non-existent file the underlying
		     directory is then accessed.

	     noatime
		     Do not update the file access time when reading from a
		     file.  This option is useful on file systems where there
		     are large numbers of files and performance is more
		     critical than updating the file access time (which is
		     rarely ever important).

	     strictatime
		     Always update the file access time when reading from a
		     file. Without this option the filesystem may default to a
		     less strict update mode, where some access time updates
		     are skipped for performance reasons. This option could be
		     ignored if it is not supported by the filesystem.

	     nobrowse
		     This option indicates that the mount point should not be
		     visible via the GUI (i.e., appear on the Desktop as a
		     separate volume).

	     nofollow
		     This option indicates that in the course of the mount
		     system call, the kernel should not follow any symlinks
		     that may be present in the provided mount-on directory.
		     This is the same as the -k option.

	     Any additional options specific to a filesystem type that is not
	     one of the internally known types (see the -t option) may be
	     passed as a comma separated list; these options are distinguished
	     by a leading “-” (dash).  Options that take a value are specified
	     using the syntax -option=value.  For example, the mount command:

		   mount -t hfs -o nosuid,-w,-m=755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

	     causes mount to execute the equivalent of:

		   /sbin/mount_hfs -o nosuid -w -m 755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

     -r      Mount the file system read-only (even the super-user may not
	     write it).  The same as the “rdonly” argument to the -o option.

     -t lfs | external type
	     The argument following the -t is used to indicate the file system
	     type.  There is no default local file system for use with mount.
	     A type must be specified in order to mount a non-NFS filesystem.
	     The -t option can be used to indicate that the actions should
	     only be taken on filesystems of the specified type.  More than
	     one type may be specified in a comma separated list.  The list of
	     filesystem types can be prefixed with “no” to specify the
	     filesystem types for which action should not be taken.  For
	     example, the mount command:

		   mount -a -t nonfs,hfs

	     mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and HFS.

	     If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
	     attempt to execute a program in /sbin/mount_XXX where XXX is
	     replaced by the type name.  For example, nfs filesystems are
	     mounted by the program /sbin/mount_nfs.

     -u      The -u flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
	     system should be changed.	Any of the options discussed above
	     (the -o option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
	     from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
	     from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the
	     filesystem are currently open for writing unless the -f flag is
	     also specified.  The set of options is determined by first
	     extracting the options for the file system from the filesystem
	     table (see getfsent(3)) then applying any options specified by
	     the -o argument, and finally applying the -r or -w option.

     -v      Verbose mode.

     -w      Mount the file system read-write.

	     The options specific to NFS filesystems are described in the
	     mount_nfs(8) manual page.



### umount

## NAME

     umount – unmount filesystems


## SYNOPSIS

     umount [-fv] special | node
     umount -a | -A [-fv] [-h host] [-t type]


## DESCRIPTION

     The umount command unmounts a mounted filesystem (volume), removing it
     from the filesystem namespace.  It calls the unmount(2) system call to
     remove a special device or the remote node (rhost:path) from the
     filesystem tree at the point node.  If either special or node are not
     provided, the appropriate information is taken from the list of
     filesystems provided by getfsent(3).

     The options are as follows:

     -a      All the filesystems described via getfsent(3) are unmounted.

     -A      All the currently mounted filesystems except the root are
	     unmounted.

     -f      The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
	     continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
	     accesses are attempted.  The root filesystem cannot be forcibly
	     unmounted.

     -h host
	     Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be
	     unmounted.  This option implies the -A option and, unless
	     otherwise specified with the -t option, will only unmount NFS
	     filesystems.

     -t type
	     Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on
	     filesystems of the specified type.  More than one type may be
	     specified in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem
	     types can be prefixed with “no” to specify the filesystem types
	     for which action should not be taken.  For example, the umount
	     command:

		   umount -A -t nfs,hfs

	     umounts all currently-mounted filesystems of the type NFS and
	     HFS.  (The -a option only unmounts entries in the /etc/fstab
	     list.)

     -v      Verbose, additional information is printed out as each filesystem
	     is unmounted.



### df

## NAME

     df – display free disk space


## SYNOPSIS

     df [--libxo] [-b | -g | -H | -h | -k | -m | -P] [-acIilntY] [-,]
	[-T type] [file | filesystem ...]


## DESCRIPTION

     The df utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on
     the specified mounted file system or on the file system of which file is
     a part.  By default block counts are displayed with an assumed block size
     of 512 bytes.  If neither a file or a file system operand is specified,
     statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed (subject to the -t
     option below).

     The following options are available:

     --libxo
	     Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
	     and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details
	     on command line arguments.

     -a      Show all mount points, including those that were mounted with the
	     MNT_IGNORE flag.  This is implied for file systems specified on
	     the command line.

     -b      Explicitly use 512 byte blocks, overriding any BLOCKSIZE
	     specification from the environment.  This is the same as the -P
	     option.  The -k option overrides this option.

     -c      Display a grand total.

     -g      Use 1073741824 byte (1 Gibibyte) blocks rather than the default.
	     This overrides any BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.

     -h      “Human-readable” output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kibibyte,
	     Mebibyte, Gibibyte, Tebibyte and Pebibyte (based on powers of
	     1024) in order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer.
	     This applies to the Size, Used, and Avail columns only; the iused
	     and ifree columns will be displayed in powers of 1000.

     -H, --si
	     Same as -h but based on powers of 1000.

     -I      Suppress inode counts.  See -i below.

     -i      Include statistics on the number of free and used inodes.	In
	     conjunction with the -h or -H options, the number of inodes is
	     scaled by powers of 1000.	In case the filesystem has no inodes
	     then ‘-’ is displayed instead of the usage percentage.

	     This option is now the default to conform to Version 3 of the
	     Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv3”).  Use -I to suppress this
	     output.

     -k      Use 1024 byte (1 Kibibyte) blocks rather than the default.  This
	     overrides the -P option and any BLOCKSIZE specification from the
	     environment.

     -l      Select locally-mounted file system for display.  If used in
	     combination with the -T type option, file system types will be
	     added or excluded acccording to the parameters of that option.

     -m      Use 1048576 byte (1 Mebibyte) blocks rather than the default.
	     This overrides any BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.

     -n      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file
	     systems.  This option should be used if it is possible that one
	     or more file systems are in a state such that they will not be
	     able to provide statistics without a long delay.  When this
	     option is specified, df will not request new statistics from the
	     file systems, but will respond with the possibly stale statistics
	     that were previously obtained.

     -P      Explicitly use 512 byte blocks, overriding any BLOCKSIZE
	     specification from the environment.  This is the same as the -b
	     option.  The -g and -k options override this option.  In
	     compatibility mode, this also suppresses inode counts.

     -T type
	     Select file systems to display.  More than one type may be
	     specified in a comma separated list.  The list of file system
	     types can be prefixed with “no” to specify the file system types
	     for which action should not be taken.  If used in combination
	     with the -l option, the parameters of this option will modify the
	     list of locally-mounted file systems selected by the -l option.
	     For example, the df command:

		   df -T nonfs,mfs

	     lists all file systems except those of type NFS and MFS.  The
	     lsvfs(1) command can be used to find out the types of file
	     systems that are available on the system.

     -t      If used with no arguments, this option is a no-op (macOS already
	     prints the total allocated-space figures).  If used with an
	     argument, it acts like -T, but this usage is deprecated and
	     should not be relied upon.

     -Y      Include file system type.

     -,      (Comma) Print sizes grouped and separated by thousands using the
	     non-monetary separator returned by localeconv(3), typically a
	     comma or period.  If no locale is set, or the locale does not
	     have a non-monetary separator, this option has no effect.



### crontab

## NAME

     crontab – maintain crontab files for individual users (V3)


## SYNOPSIS

     crontab [-u user] file
     crontab [-u user] { -l | -r | -e }


## DESCRIPTION

     The crontab utility is the program used to install, deinstall or list the
     tables used to drive the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.  Each user can
     have their own crontab, and they are not intended to be edited directly.

     (Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported
     under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8),
     which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.
     See launchctl(1) for more information.)

     If the /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed
     therein in order to be allowed to use this command.  If the
     /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow file does not exist but the
     /usr/lib/cron/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in
     the /usr/lib/cron/cron.deny file in order to use this command.  If
     neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent
     configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this
     command, or all users will be able to use this command.  The format of
     these files is one username per line, with no leading or trailing
     whitespace.  Lines of other formats will be ignored, and so can be used
     for comments.

     The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some
     named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename ‘-’ is given.

     The following options are available:

     -u      Specify the name of the user whose crontab is to be tweaked.  If
	     this option is not given, crontab examines “your” crontab, i.e.,
	     the crontab of the person executing the command.  Note that su(1)
	     can confuse crontab and that if you are running inside of su(1)
		 you should always use the -u option for safety's sake.

	 -l      Display the current crontab on standard output.

	 -r      Remove the current crontab.

	 -e      Edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL
		 or EDITOR environment variables.  The specified editor must edit
		 the file in place; any editor that unlinks the file and recreates
		 it cannot be used.  After you exit from the editor, the modified
		 crontab will be installed automatically.



### at

## NAME

	 at, batch, atq, atrm – queue, examine or delete jobs for later execution


## SYNOPSIS

	 at [-q queue] [-f file] [-mldbv] time
	 at [-q queue] [-f file] [-mldbv] -t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
	 at -c job [job ...]
	 at -l [job ...]
	 at -l -q queue
	 at -r job [job ...]

	 atq [-q queue] [-v]

	 atrm job [job ...]

	 batch [-q queue] [-f file] [-mv] [time]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The at and batch utilities read commands from standard input or a
	 specified file which are to be executed at a later time, using sh(1).

	 at      executes commands at a specified time;

	 atq     lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser;
		 in that case, everybody's jobs are listed;

	 atrm    deletes jobs;

	 batch   executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words,
		 when the load average drops below 1.5 times number of active
		 CPUs, or the value specified in the invocation of atrun.

	 The at utility allows some moderately complex time specifications.  It
	 accepts times of the form HHMM or HH:MM to run a job at a specific time
	 of day.  (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)	As an
	 alternative, the following keywords may be specified: midnight, noon, or
	 teatime (4pm) and time-of-day may be suffixed with AM, PM, or UTC for
	 running in the morning, the evening, or in UTC time.  The day on which
	 the job is to be run may also be specified by giving a date in the form
	 month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the forms
	 DD.MM.YYYY, DD.MM.YY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, MMDDYYYY, or MMDDYY.  The
	 specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day.
	 Time can also be specified as: [now] + count time-units, where the time-
	 units can be minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years and at may be
	 told to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the
	 job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.	The shortcut next can
	 be used instead of + 1.

	 For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, use at 4pm + 3
	 days, to run a job at 10:00am on July 31, use at 10am Jul 31 and to run a
	 job at 1am tomorrow, use at 1am tomorrow.

	 The at utility also supports the POSIX time format (see -t option).

	 For both at and batch, commands are read from standard input or the file
	 specified with the -f option and executed.  The working directory, the
	 environment (except for the variables TERM, TERMCAP, DISPLAY and _) and
	 the umask are retained from the time of invocation.  An at or batch
	 command invoked from a su(1) shell will retain the current userid.  The
	 user will be mailed standard error and standard output from his commands,
	 if any.  Mail will be sent using the command sendmail(8).	If at is
	 executed from a su(1) shell, the owner of the login shell will receive
	 the mail.

	 The superuser may use these commands in any case.	For other users,
	 permission to use at is determined by the files /usr/lib/cron/at.allow
	 and /usr/lib/cron/at.deny.

	 If the file /usr/lib/cron/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it
	 are allowed to use at.  In these two files, a user is considered to be
	 listed only if the user name has no blank or other characters before it
	 on its line and a newline character immediately after the name, even at
	 the end of the file.  Other lines are ignored and may be used for
	 comments.

	 If /usr/lib/cron/at.allow does not exist, /usr/lib/cron/at.deny is
	 checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at.

	 If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed use of at.  This is the
	 default configuration.



### env

## NAME

	 env – set environment and execute command, or print environment


## SYNOPSIS

	 env [-0iv] [-u name] [name=value ...]
	 env [-iv] [-C altwd] [-P altpath] [-S string] [-u name] [name=value ...]
	 utility [argument ...]


## DESCRIPTION

	 The env utility executes another utility after modifying the environment
	 as specified on the command line.	Each name=value option specifies the
	 setting of an environment variable, name, with a value of value.  All
	 such environment variables are set before the utility is executed.

	 The options are as follows:

	 -0      End each output line with NUL, not newline.

	 -i      Execute the utility with only those environment variables
		 specified by name=value options.  The environment inherited by
		 env is ignored completely.

	 -C altwd
		 Change to the specified alternate working directory before
		 executing the specified utility program.

	 -P altpath
		 Search the set of directories as specified by altpath to locate
		 the specified utility program, instead of using the value of the
		 PATH environment variable.

	 -S string
		 Split apart the given string into multiple strings, and process
		 each of the resulting strings as separate arguments to the env
		 utility.  The -S option recognizes some special character escape
		 sequences and also supports environment-variable substitution, as
		 described below.

	 -u name
		 If the environment variable name is in the environment, then
		 remove it before processing the remaining options.  This is
		 similar to the unset command in sh(1).  The value for name must
		 not include the ‘=’ character.

	 -v      Print verbose information for each step of processing done by the
		 env utility.  Additional information will be printed if -v is
		 specified multiple times.

	 The above options are only recognized when they are specified before any
	 name=value options.

	 If no utility is specified, env prints out the names and values of the
	 variables in the environment.  Each name/value pair is separated by a new
	 line unless -0 is specified, in which case name/value pairs are separated
	 by NUL.  Both -0 and utility may not be specified together.

	 The env utility does not handle values of utility which have an equals
	 sign (‘=’) in their name, for obvious reasons.  This can easily be worked
	 around by interposing the command(1) utility, which simply executes its
	 arguments; see EXAMPLES below.

   Details of -S (split-string) processing
	 The processing of the -S option will split the given string into separate
	 arguments based on any space or <tab> characters found in the string.
	 Each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been
	 specified as a separate argument on the original env command.

	 Spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using
	 single (“'”) or double (‘"’) quotes, or backslashes (‘\’).  Single quotes
     will escape all non-single quote characters, up to the matching single
     quote.  Double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters, up to
     the matching double quote.  It is an error if the end of the string is
     reached before the matching quote character.

     If -S would create a new argument that starts with the ‘#’ character,
     then that argument and the remainder of the string will be ignored.  The
     ‘\#’ sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start with a
     ‘#’ character, without causing the remainder of the string to be skipped.

     While processing the string value, -S processing will treat certain
     character combinations as escape sequences which represent some action to
     take.  The character escape sequences are in backslash notation.  The
     characters and their meanings are as follows:

	   \c	   Ignore the remaining characters in the string.  This must
		   not appear inside a double-quoted string.
	   \f	   Replace with a <form-feed> character.
	   \n	   Replace with a <new-line> character.
	   \r	   Replace with a <carriage return> character.
	   \t	   Replace with a <tab> character.
	   \v	   Replace with a <vertical tab> character.
	   \#	   Replace with a ‘#’ character.  This would be useful when
		   you need a ‘#’ as the first character in one of the
		   arguments created by splitting apart the given string.
	   \$	   Replace with a ‘$’ character.
	   \_	   If this is found inside of a double-quoted string, then
		   replace it with a single blank.  If this is found outside
		   of a quoted string, then treat this as the separator
		   character between new arguments in the original string.
	   \"	   Replace with a <double quote> character.
	   \´	   Replace with a <single quote> character.
	   \\	   Replace with a backslash character.

     The sequences for <single-quote> and backslash are the only sequences
     which are recognized inside of a single-quoted string.  The other
     sequences have no special meaning inside a single-quoted string.  All
     escape sequences are recognized inside of a double-quoted string.	It is
     an error if a single ‘\’ character is followed by a character other than
     the ones listed above.

     The processing of -S also supports substitution of values from
     environment variables.  To do this, the name of the environment variable
     must be inside of ‘${}’, such as: ${SOMEVAR}.  The common shell syntax of
     $SOMEVAR is not supported.  All values substituted will be the values of
     the environment variables as they were when the env utility was
     originally invoked.  Those values will not be checked for any of the
     escape sequences as described above.  And any settings of name=value will
     not effect the values used for substitution in -S processing.

     Also, -S processing cannot reference the value of the special parameters
     which are defined by most shells.	For instance, -S cannot recognize
     special parameters such as: ‘$*’, ‘$@’, ‘$#’, ‘$?’ or ‘$$’ if they appear
     inside the given string.

   Use in shell-scripts
     The env utility is often used as the interpreter on the first line of
     interpreted scripts, as described in execve(2).

     Note that the ‘#!’ (first line) of an interpreted script is parsed
     differently on Darwin than it is on many other common systems.  The first
     line will be split into separate arguments based on any whitespace (space
     or ⟨tab⟩ characters) found in the line.  So, if a script named
     /usr/local/bin/someport has a first line of:

	   #!/usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0

     then the /usr/local/bin/php program will be started with the arguments
     of:

	   arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'
	   arg[1] = '-n'
	   arg[2] = '-q'
	   arg[3] = '-dsafe_mode=0'
	   arg[4] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'

     plus any arguments the user specified when executing someport.  However,
     this processing of multiple options on the ‘#!’ line is not the way many
     other operating system parse the first line of an interpreted script.
     Notably, the same first line on other systems will result in
     /usr/local/bin/php being started with the arguments of:

	   arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'
	   arg[1] = '-n -q -dsafe_mode=0'
	   arg[2] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'

     plus any arguments the user specified.  As a result, uses of the -S
     option like this:

	   #!/usr/bin/env -S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0

     will behave differently than expected on Darwin, which will instead parse
     the original version of this first line as if it were executed directly
     in a shell.



### printenv

## NAME

     printenv – print out the environment


## SYNOPSIS

     printenv [name]


## DESCRIPTION

     The printenv utility prints out the names and values of the variables in
     the environment, with one name/value pair per line.  If name is
     specified, only its value is printed.

     Some shells may provide a builtin printenv command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     where, which, while – shell built-in commands


## SYNOPSIS

     See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual
     page.


## DESCRIPTION

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the
	 running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin
	 commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any
	 component of a pipeline except the last.

	 If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ‘/’, the shell will
	 not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
	 specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
	 specifying “echo” causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
	 that support the echo builtin command, specifying “/bin/echo” or “./echo”
	 does not.

	 While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their
	 operation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below
	 is a table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that
	 support them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

	 Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
	 Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.	Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands “built-in commands” and some of them “reserved words”.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked “No**” under External do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

## SYNOPSIS

     See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual
     page.


## DESCRIPTION

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the
	 running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin
	 commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any
	 component of a pipeline except the last.

	 If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ‘/’, the shell will
	 not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
	 specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
	 specifying “echo” causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
	 that support the echo builtin command, specifying “/bin/echo” or “./echo”
	 does not.

	 While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their
	 operation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below
	 is a table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that
	 support them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

	 Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
	 Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.	Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands “built-in commands” and some of them “reserved words”.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked “No**” under External do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

### clear

## NAME

       clear - clear the terminal screen


## SYNOPSIS

       clear


## DESCRIPTION

       clear clears your screen if this is possible, including its scrollback
       buffer (if the extended "E3" capability is defined).  clear looks in
       the environment for the terminal type and then in the terminfo database
       to determine how to clear the screen.

       clear ignores any command-line parameters that may be present.



### reset

## NAME

       tput, reset - initialize a terminal or query terminfo database


## SYNOPSIS

       tput [-Ttype] capname [parms ... ]
       tput [-Ttype] init
       tput [-Ttype] reset
       tput [-Ttype] longname
       tput -S	<<
       tput -V


## DESCRIPTION

       The tput utility uses the terminfo database to make the values of
       terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to the shell
       (see sh(1)), to initialize or reset the terminal, or return the long
       name of the requested terminal type.  The result depends upon the
	   capability's type:

		  string
		   tput writes the string to the standard output.  No trailing
		   newline is supplied.

		  integer
		   tput writes the decimal value to the standard output, with
		   a trailing newline.

		  boolean
		   tput simply sets the exit code (0 for TRUE if the terminal
		   has the capability, 1 for FALSE if it does not), and writes
		   nothing to the standard output.

	   Before using a value returned on the standard output, the application
	   should test the exit code (e.g., $?, see sh(1)) to be sure it is 0.
	   (See the EXIT CODES and DIAGNOSTICS sections.)  For a complete list of
	   capabilities and the capname associated with each, see terminfo(5).

	   -Ttype indicates the type of terminal.  Normally this option is
		  unnecessary, because the default is taken from the environment
		  variable TERM.  If -T is specified, then the shell variables
		  LINES and COLUMNS will also be ignored.

	   capname
		  indicates the capability from the terminfo database.  When
		  termcap support is compiled in, the termcap name for the
		  capability is also accepted.

	   parms  If the capability is a string that takes parameters, the
		  arguments parms will be instantiated into the string.

		  Most parameters are numbers.  Only a few terminfo capabilities
		  require string parameters; tput uses a table to decide which to
		  pass as strings.	Normally tput uses tparm (3X) to perform the
		  substitution.  If no parameters are given for the capability,
		  tput writes the string without performing the substitution.

	   -S     allows more than one capability per invocation of tput.  The
		  capabilities must be passed to tput from the standard input
		  instead of from the command line (see example).  Only one
		  capname is allowed per line.  The -S option changes the meaning
		  of the 0 and 1 boolean and string exit codes (see the EXIT CODES
		  section).

		  Again, tput uses a table and the presence of parameters in its
		  input to decide whether to use tparm (3X), and how to interpret
		  the parameters.

	   -V     reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program,
		  and exits.

	   init   If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user's
	      terminal exists (see -Ttype, above), the following will occur:

		  (1)    if present, the terminal's initialization strings will be
			 output as detailed in the terminfo(5) section on Tabs and
			 Initialization,

		  (2)    any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry will be
			 set in the tty driver,

		  (3)    tabs expansion will be turned on or off according to the
			 specification in the entry, and

		  (4)    if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will be set
			 (every 8 spaces).

		  If an entry does not contain the information needed for any of
		  the four above activities, that activity will silently be
		  skipped.

	   reset  Instead of putting out initialization strings, the terminal's
	      reset strings will be output if present (rs1, rs2, rs3, rf).  If
	      the reset strings are not present, but initialization strings
	      are, the initialization strings will be output.  Otherwise,
	      reset acts identically to init.

       longname
		  If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user's
		  terminal exists (see -Ttype above), then the long name of the
		  terminal will be put out.  The long name is the last name in the
		  first line of the terminal's description in the terminfo
	      database [see term(5)].

       If tput is invoked by a link named reset, this has the same effect as
       tput reset.  See @TSET@ for comparison, which has similar behavior.

## SYNOPSIS

     See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual
     page.


## DESCRIPTION

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the
	 running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin
	 commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any
	 component of a pipeline except the last.

	 If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ‘/’, the shell will
	 not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
	 specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
	 specifying “echo” causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
	 that support the echo builtin command, specifying “/bin/echo” or “./echo”
	 does not.

	 While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their
	 operation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below
	 is a table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that
	 support them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

	 Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
	 Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.	Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands “built-in commands” and some of them “reserved words”.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked “No**” under External do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

### vi

## NAME

	   vim - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor


## SYNOPSIS

	   vim [options] [file ..]
	   vim [options] -
	   vim [options] -t tag
	   vim [options] -q [errorfile]

	   ex
	   view
	   gvim gview evim eview
	   rvim rview rgvim rgview


## DESCRIPTION

	   Vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used
	   to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful for editing
	   programs.

	   There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi
	   windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing,
	   filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..  See ":help
	   vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

	   While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help
	   system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

	   Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

		vim file

	   More generally Vim is started with:

		vim [options] [filelist]

	   If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
	   Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose
	   one or more files to be edited.

	   file ..	   A list of filenames.  The first one will be the current
		   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor will be
		   positioned on the first line of the buffer.	You can get to
		   the other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file
		   that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

	   -	   The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read
		   from stderr, which should be a tty.

	   -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
		   a "tag", a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the
		   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
		   the associated command is executed.	Mostly this is used
		   for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function
		   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function
		   becomes the current file and the cursor is positioned on
		   the start of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

	   -q [errorfile]
		   Start in quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and
		   the first error is displayed.  If [errorfile] is omitted,
		   the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile' option
		   (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the Amiga, "errors.err" on
		   other systems).  Further errors can be jumped to with the
		   ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

	   Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the
	   executable may still be the same file).

	   vim	 The "normal" way, everything is default.

	   ex	 Start in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
		 Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

	   view	 Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing
		 the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

	   gvim gview
		 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with
		 the "-g" argument.

	   evim eview
		 The GUI version in easy mode.	Starts a new window.  Can also
		 be done with the "-y" argument.

	   rvim rview rgvim rgview
		 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be
		 possible to start shell commands, or suspend Vim.  Can also
		 be done with the "-Z" argument.

## DESCRIPTION

     The diff utility compares the contents of file1 and file2 and writes to
     the standard output the list of changes necessary to convert one file
     into the other.  No output is produced if the files are identical.

     Output options (mutually exclusive):

     -C number --context number
	     Like -c but produces a diff with number lines of context.

     -c      Produces a diff with 3 lines of context.  With -c the output
	     format is modified slightly: the output begins with
	     identification of the files involved and their creation dates and
		 then each change is separated by a line with fifteen *'s.	The
		 lines removed from file1 are marked with ‘- ’; those added to
		 file2 are marked ‘+ ’.  Lines which are changed from one file to
		 the other are marked in both files with ‘! ’.  Changes which lie
		 within 3 lines of each other are grouped together on output.

	 -D string --ifdef string
		 Creates a merged version of file1 and file2 on the standard
		 output, with C preprocessor controls included so that a
		 compilation of the result without defining string is equivalent
		 to compiling file1, while defining string will yield file2.

	 -e --ed
		 Produces output in a form suitable as input for the editor
		 utility, ed(1), which can then be used to convert file1 into
		 file2.

		 Note that when comparing directories with -e, the resulting file
		 may no longer be interpreted as an ed(1) script.  Output is added
		 to indicate which file each set of ed(1) commands applies to.
		 These hunks can be manually extracted to produce an ed(1) script,
		 which can also be applied with patch(1).

	 -f --forward-ed
		 Identical output to that of the -e flag, but in reverse order.
		 It cannot be digested by ed(1).

	 --help  This option prints a summary to stdout and exits with status 0.

	 -n      Produces a script similar to that of -e, but in the opposite
		 order and with a count of changed lines on each insert or delete
		 command.  This is the form used by rcsdiff.

	 -q --brief
		 Just print a line when the files differ.  Does not output a list
		 of changes.

	 -U number --unified number
		 Like -u but produces a diff with number lines of context.

	 -u      Produces a unified diff with 3 lines of context.  A unified diff
		 is similar to the context diff produced by the -c option.
		 However, unlike with -c, all lines to be changed (added and/or
		 removed) are present in a single section.

	 --version
		 This option prints a version string to stdout and exits with
		 status 0.

	 -y --side-by-side
		 Output in two columns with a marker between them.	The marker can
		 be one of the following:

		   space   Corresponding lines are identical.
		   '|'	   Corresponding lines are different.
		   '<'	   Files differ and only the first file contains the
			   line.
		   '>'	   Files differ and only the second file contains the
			   line.

	 Comparison options:

	 -A algo, --algorithm algo
		 Configure the algorithm used when comparing files.  diff supports
		 3 algorithms:

		 myers   The Myers diff algorithm finds the shortest edit which
			 transforms one input into the other.  It generally runs
			 in O(N+D²) time, requiring O(N) space, where N is the sum
			 of the lengths of the inputs and D is the length of the
			 difference between them, with a theoretical O(N·D) worst
			 case.  If it encounters worst-case input, the
			 implementation used by diff falls back to a less optimal
			 but faster algorithm.
		 patience
			 The Patience variant of the Myers algorithm attempts to
			 create more aesthetically pleasing diff output by
			 logically grouping lines.
		 stone   The Stone algorithm (commonly known as Hunt-McIlroy or
			 Hunt-Szymanski) looks for the longest common subsequence
			 between compared files.  Stone encounters worst case
			 performance when there are long common subsequences.  In
			 large files this can lead to a significant performance
			 impact.  The Stone algorithm is maintained for
			 compatibility.

		 The default algorithm is affected by the POSIXLY_CORRECT and
		 POSIX_PEDANTIC environment variables.  When either variable is
		 set the default algorithm will be “stone”.  Otherwise, the diff
		 utility defaults to the Myers algorithm, but will fall back to
		 the Stone algorithm if the input or output options are not
		 supported by the Myers implementation.

	 -a --text
		 Treat all files as ASCII text.  Normally diff will simply print
		 “Binary files ... differ” if files contain binary characters.
		 Use of this option forces diff to produce a diff.

	 -B --ignore-blank-lines
		 Causes chunks that include only blank lines to be ignored.

	 -b --ignore-space-change
		 Causes trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) to be ignored, and other
		 strings of blanks to compare equal.

	 --color=[when]
		 Color the additions green, and removals red, or the value in the
		 DIFFCOLORS environment variable.  The possible values of when are
		 “never”, “always” and “auto”.  auto will use color if the output
		 is a tty and the COLORTERM environment variable is set to a non-
		 empty string.

	 -d --minimal
		 Try very hard to produce a diff as small as possible.  This may
		 consume a lot of processing power and memory when processing
		 large files with many changes.

	 -F pattern, --show-function-line pattern
		 Like -p, but display the last line that matches provided pattern.

	 -I pattern --ignore-matching-lines pattern
		 Ignores changes, insertions, and deletions whose lines match the
		 extended regular expression pattern.  Multiple -I patterns may be
		 specified.  All lines in the change must match some pattern for
		 the change to be ignored.	See re_format(7) for more information
		 on regular expression patterns.

	 -i --ignore-case
		 Ignores the case of letters.  E.g., “A” will compare equal to
		 “a”.

	 -l --paginate
		 Pass the output through pr(1) to paginate it.

	 -L label --label label
		 Print label instead of the first (and second, if this option is
		 specified twice) file name and time in the context or unified
		 diff header.

	 -p --show-c-function
		 With unified and context diffs, show with each change the first
		 40 characters of the last line before the context beginning with
		 a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign.	For C and Objective-C
		 source code following standard layout conventions, this will show
		 the prototype of the function the change applies to.

	 -T --initial-tab
		 Print a tab rather than a space before the rest of the line for
		 the normal, context or unified output formats.  This makes the
		 alignment of tabs in the line consistent.

	 -t --expand-tabs
		 Will expand tabs in output lines.	Normal or -c output adds
		 character(s) to the front of each line which may screw up the
		 indentation of the original source lines and make the output
		 listing difficult to interpret.  This option will preserve the
		 original source's indentation.

     -w --ignore-all-blanks
	     Is similar to -b --ignore-space-change but causes whitespace
	     (blanks and tabs) to be totally ignored.  E.g., “if ( a == b )”
	     will compare equal to “if(a==b)”.

     -W number --width number
	     Output at most number columns when using side by side format.
	     The default value is 130.	Note that unless

     -t      was specified, diff will always align the second column to a tab
	     stop, so values of --width smaller than approximately five times
	     the value of --tabsize may yield surprising results.

     --changed-group-format GFMT
	     Format input groups in the provided

	     the format is a string with special keywords:

	     %<  lines from FILE1

	     %<  lines from FILE2

     --ignore-file-name-case
	     ignore case when comparing file names

     --no-ignore-file-name-case
	     do not ignore case when comparing file names (default)

     --normal
	     default diff output

     --speed-large-files
	     stub option for compatibility with GNU diff

     --strip-trailing-cr
	     strip carriage return on input files

     --suppress-common-lines
	     Do not output common lines when using the side by side format

     --tabsize number
	     Number of spaces representing a tab (default 8)

     Directory comparison options:

     -N --new-file
	     If a file is found in only one directory, act as if it was found
	     in the other directory too but was of zero size.

     -P --unidirectional-new-file
	     If a file is found only in dir2, act as if it was found in dir1
	     too but was of zero size.

     -r --recursive
	     Causes application of diff recursively to common subdirectories
	     encountered.

     -S name --starting-file name
	     Re-starts a directory diff in the middle, beginning with file
	     name.

     -s --report-identical-files
	     Causes diff to report files which are the same, which are
	     otherwise not mentioned.

     -X file --exclude-from file
	     Exclude files and subdirectories from comparison whose basenames
	     match lines in file.  Multiple -X options may be specified.

     -x pattern --exclude pattern
	     Exclude files and subdirectories from comparison whose basenames
	     match pattern.  Patterns are matched using shell-style globbing
	     via fnmatch(3).  Multiple -x options may be specified.

     If both arguments are directories, diff sorts the contents of the
     directories by name, and then runs the regular file diff algorithm,
     producing a change list, on text files which are different.  Binary files
     which differ, common subdirectories, and files which appear in only one
     directory are described as such.  In directory mode only regular files
     and directories are compared.  If a non-regular file such as a device
     special file or FIFO is encountered, a diagnostic message is printed.

     If only one of file1 and file2 is a directory, diff is applied to the
     non-directory file and the file contained in the directory file with a
     filename that is the same as the last component of the non-directory
     file.

     If either file1 or file2 is ‘-’, the standard input is used in its place.

   Output Style
     The default (without -e, -c, or -n --rcs options) output contains lines
     of these forms, where XX, YY, ZZ, QQ are line numbers respective of file
     order.

     XXaYY	  At (the end of) line XX of file1, append the contents of
		  line YY of file2 to make them equal.
     XXaYY,ZZ	  Same as above, but append the range of lines, YY through ZZ
		  of file2 to line XX of file1.
     XXdYY	  At line XX delete the line.  The value YY tells to which
		  line the change would bring file1 in line with file2.
     XX,YYdZZ	  Delete the range of lines XX through YY in file1.
     XXcYY	  Change the line XX in file1 to the line YY in file2.
     XX,YYcZZ	  Replace the range of specified lines with the line ZZ.
     XX,YYcZZ,QQ  Replace the range XX,YY from file1 with the range ZZ,QQ from
		  file2.

     These lines resemble ed(1) subcommands to convert file1 into file2.  The
     line numbers before the action letters pertain to file1; those after
     pertain to file2.	Thus, by exchanging a for d and reading the line in
     reverse order, one can also determine how to convert file2 into file1.
     As in ed(1), identical pairs (where num1 = num2) are abbreviated as a
     single number.



### patch

## NAME

     patch – apply a diff file to an original


## SYNOPSIS

     patch [-bCcEeflNnRstuv] [-B backup-prefix] [-D symbol] [-d directory]
	   [-g vcs-option] [-F max-fuzz] [-i patchfile] [-o out-file]
	   [-p strip-count] [-r rej-name] [-T | -Z]
	   [-V t | nil | never | none] [-x number] [-Y prefix] [-z backup-ext]
	   [--quoting-style style] [--posix] [origfile [patchfile]]
     patch <patchfile


## DESCRIPTION

     patch will take a patch file containing any of the four forms of
     difference listing produced by the diff(1) program and apply those
     differences to an original file, producing a patched version.  If
     patchfile is omitted, or is a hyphen, the patch will be read from the
     standard input.

     patch will attempt to determine the type of the diff listing, unless
     overruled by a -c, -e, -n, or -u option.  Context diffs (old-style, new-
     style, and unified) and normal diffs are applied directly by the patch
     program itself, whereas ed diffs are simply fed to the ed(1) editor via a
     pipe.

     If the patchfile contains more than one patch, patch will try to apply
     each of them as if they came from separate patch files.  This means,
     among other things, that it is assumed that the name of the file to patch
     must be determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage before
     each diff listing will be examined for interesting things such as file
     names and revision level (see the section on Filename Determination
     below).

     The options are as follows:

     -B backup-prefix, --prefix backup-prefix
	     Causes the next argument to be interpreted as a prefix to the
	     backup file name.	If this argument is specified, any argument to
	     -z will be ignored.

     -b, --backup
	     Save a backup copy of the file before it is modified.  By default
	     the original file is saved with a backup extension of ".orig"
	     unless the file already has a numbered backup, in which case a
	     numbered backup is made.  This is equivalent to specifying "-V
	     existing".

     --backup-if-mismatch
	     Save a backup copy of the file before it is modified, but only if
	     a mismatch was encountered.  Specifically, this will create a
	     backup file if a hunk failed to apply, or if fuzz was required to
	     apply one or more hunks.  As with the -b option,
	     --backup-if-mismatch will use the existing format that is
	     accepted by the -V option when a backup is to be created.

	     If backups were otherwise requested with the -b option, then this
	     option has no effect.

	     This option is currently the default, unless --posix is
	     specified.

     --no-backup-if-mismatch
	     This option negates --backup-if-mismatch, creating backups for
	     every file unless backups have been disabled with --posix or -V
	     none.

     -C, --check, --dry-run
	     Checks that the patch would apply cleanly, but does not modify
	     anything.

     -c, --context
	     Forces patch to interpret the patch file as a context diff.

     -D symbol, --ifdef symbol
	     Causes patch to use the "#ifdef...#endif" construct to mark
	     changes.  The argument following will be used as the
	     differentiating symbol.  Note that, unlike the C compiler, there
	     must be a space between the -D and the argument.

     -d directory, --directory directory
	     Causes patch to interpret the next argument as a directory, and
	     change the working directory to it before doing anything else.

     -E, --remove-empty-files
	     Causes patch to remove output files that are empty after the
	     patches have been applied.  This option is useful when applying
	     patches that create or remove files.

     -e, --ed
	     Forces patch to interpret the patch file as an ed(1) script.

     -F max-fuzz, --fuzz max-fuzz
	     Sets the maximum fuzz factor.  This option only applies to
	     context diffs, and causes patch to ignore up to that many lines
	     in looking for places to install a hunk.  Note that a larger fuzz
	     factor increases the odds of a faulty patch.  The default fuzz
	     factor is 2, and it may not be set to more than the number of
	     lines of context in the context diff, ordinarily 3.

     -f, --force
	     Forces patch to assume that the user knows exactly what he or she
	     is doing, and to not ask any questions.  It assumes the
	     following: skip patches for which a file to patch cannot be
	     found; patch files even though they have the wrong version for
	     the "Prereq": line in the patch; and assume that patches are not
	     reversed even if they look like they are.	This option does not
	     suppress commentary; use -s for that.

     -g vcs-option, --get vcs-option
	     Causes patch to consult some version control systems for missing
	     or read-only files.  This version of patch has limited, detect-
	     only support for SCCS and ClearCase, but full support for RCS and
	     Perforce.

	     If vcs-option is set to 0, then patch will not consult any
	     version control system.  This is the default behavior, unless
	     overruled by setting the PATCH_GET environment variable.

	     If vcs-option is set to a negative number, then patch will prompt
	     to confirm that it is OK to checkout each file that is detected
	     under a supported version control system.

	     If vcs-option is set to a positive number, then patch will not
	     prompt before checking out each file that is detected under a
	     supported version control system.

	     Note that one must be in the root directory of the repository in
	     order for --get to work, unless patch is operating in a Perforce
	     workspace.

	     The --get option may also influence how a filename is chosen.
	     See Filename Determination below for details.

     --help  Print a help message and exit.

     -i patchfile, --input patchfile
	     Causes the next argument to be interpreted as the input file name
	     (i.e., a patchfile).  This option may be specified multiple
	     times.

     -l, --ignore-whitespace
	     Causes the pattern matching to be done loosely, in case the tabs
	     and spaces have been munged in your input file.  Any sequence of
	     whitespace in the pattern line will match any sequence in the
	     input file.  Normal characters must still match exactly.  Each
	     line of the context must still match a line in the input file.

     -N, --forward
	     Causes patch to ignore patches that it thinks are reversed or
	     already applied.  See also -R.

     -n, --normal
	     Forces patch to interpret the patch file as a normal diff.

     -o out-file, --output out-file
	     Causes the next argument to be interpreted as the output file
	     name.

     -p strip-count, --strip strip-count
	     Sets the pathname strip count, which controls how pathnames found
	     in the patch file are treated, in case you keep your files in a
	     different directory than the person who sent out the patch.  The
	     strip count specifies how many slashes are to be stripped from
	     the front of the pathname.  (Any intervening directory names also
	     go away.)	For example, supposing the file name in the patch file
	     was /u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c:

	     Setting -p0 gives the entire pathname unmodified.

	     -p1 gives

		   u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

	     without the leading slash.

	     -p4 gives

		   blurfl/blurfl.c

	     Not specifying -p at all just gives you blurfl.c, unless all of
	     the directories in the leading path (u/howard/src/blurfl) exist
	     and that path is relative, in which case you get the entire
	     pathname unmodified.  Whatever you end up with is looked for
	     either in the current directory, or the directory specified by
	     the -d option.

     --quoting-style style
	     Controls how patch writes out filenames to the console.  The
	     valid values for style are:

		   literal
			   Write filenames without any special quoting.

		   shell   Quote filenames if they contain shell
			   metacharacters, or other characters that may be
			   problematic, e.g., spaces.

		   shell-always
			   Always quote filenames as if they contain shell
			   metacharacters or other problematic characters.

		   c	   Quote filenames as if they are a C style string.

		   escape  Does the same as c, except quotes will be omitted.

	     The default quoting option is shell, unless QUOTING_STYLE is set.

     -R, --reverse
	     Tells patch that this patch was created with the old and new
	     files swapped.  (Yes, I am afraid that does happen occasionally,
	     human nature being what it is.)  patch will attempt to swap each
	     hunk around before applying it.  Rejects will come out in the
	     swapped format.  The -R option will not work with ed diff scripts
	     because there is too little information to reconstruct the
	     reverse operation.

	     If the first hunk of a patch fails, patch will reverse the hunk
	     to see if it can be applied that way.  If it can, you will be
	     asked if you want to have the -R option set.  If it cannot, the
	     patch will continue to be applied normally.  (Note: this method
	     cannot detect a reversed patch if it is a normal diff and if the
	     first command is an append (i.e., it should have been a delete)
	     since appends always succeed, due to the fact that a null context
	     will match anywhere.  Luckily, most patches add or change lines
	     rather than delete them, so most reversed normal diffs will begin
	     with a delete, which will fail, triggering the heuristic.)

     -r rej-name, --reject-file rej-name
	     Causes the next argument to be interpreted as the reject file
	     name.

     -s, --quiet, --silent
	     Makes patch do its work silently, unless an error occurs.

     -T, --set-time
	     Tells patch to set the access and modification times of the
		 output file based on timestamps included in the diff's header.
		 The -T option will force patch to assume the timestamps provided
		 are in the system's local timezone, unless a timezone offset is
	     present in the timstamp.

	     patch will not change the times on the output file unless the
		 original file's timestamp matches the proper file's timestamp in
	     the diff header and the patch context matched the original file
	     with neither fuzz nor offsets.  Both of these caveats are ignored
	     if the -f flag has been specified.

     -t, --batch
	     Similar to -f, in that it suppresses questions, but makes some
	     different assumptions: skip patches for which a file to patch
	     cannot be found (the same as -f); skip patches for which the file
	     has the wrong version for the "Prereq": line in the patch; and
	     assume that patches are reversed if they look like they are.

     -u, --unified
	     Forces patch to interpret the patch file as a unified context
	     diff (a unidiff).

     -V t | nil | never | none, --version-control t | nil | never | none
	     Causes the next argument to be interpreted as a method for
	     creating backup file names.  The type of backups made can also be
	     given in the PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL or VERSION_CONTROL environment
	     variables, which are overridden by this option.  The -B option
	     overrides this option, causing the prefix to always be used for
	     making backup file names.	The values of the
	     PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL and VERSION_CONTROL environment variables
	     and the argument to the -V option are like the GNU Emacs
	     “version-control” variable; they also recognize synonyms that are
	     more descriptive.	The valid values are (unique abbreviations are
	     accepted):

		   t, numbered
			   Always make numbered backups.

		   nil, existing
			   Make numbered backups of files that already have
			   them, simple backups of the others.

		   never, simple
			   Always make simple backups.

		   none    Do not make backups.

     -v, --version
	     Causes patch to print out its revision header and patch level.

     -x number, --debug number
	     Sets internal debugging flags, and is of interest only to patch
	     patchers.

     -Y prefix, --basename-prefix prefix
	     Prepend prefix to the basename of the file to be backed up.  For
	     example, specifying “-Y 0_” when patching a file
	     /u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c will create the backup at
	     /u/howard/src/blurfl/0_blurfl.c.orig.

     -Z, --set-utc
	     Tells patch to set the access and modification times of the
		 output file based on timestamps included in the diff's header.
		 The -Z option will force patch to assume the timestamps provided
		 are in UTC unless the timezone offset is present in the timstamp.
		 Note that the caveats described with the -T option about when the
		 output file's modification time is changed also apply to the -Z
	     option.

     -z backup-ext, --suffix backup-ext
	     Causes the next argument to be interpreted as the backup
	     extension, to be used in place of ".orig".

     --posix
	     Enables strict IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) conformance,
	     specifically:

	     1.   Backup files are not created unless the -b option is
		  specified.

	     2.   If unspecified, the file name used is the first of the old,
		  new and index files that exists.

   Patch Application
     patch will try to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip
     any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or message
     containing a diff listing to patch, and it should work.  If the entire
     diff is indented by a consistent amount, this will be taken into account.

     With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, patch can
     detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
     will attempt to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch.
     As a first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus
     or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If that is not
     the correct place, patch will scan both forwards and backwards for a set
     of lines matching the context given in the hunk.  First patch looks for a
     place where all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found,
     and it is a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or
     more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of
     context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more,
     the first two and last two lines of context are ignored, and another scan
     is made.  (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2).

     If patch cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch, it will
     put the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name of the
     output file plus ".rej".  (Note that the rejected hunk will come out in
     context diff form whether the input patch was a context diff or a normal
     diff.  If the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts will simply
     be null.)	The line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be
     different than in the patch file: they reflect the approximate location
     patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file rather than the old
     one.

     As each hunk is completed, you will be told whether the hunk succeeded or
     failed, and which line (in the new file) patch thought the hunk should go
     on.  If this is different from the line number specified in the diff, you
     will be told the offset.  A single large offset MAY be an indication that
     a hunk was installed in the wrong place.  You will also be told if a fuzz
     factor was used to make the match, in which case you should also be
     slightly suspicious.

   Filename Determination
     If no original file is specified on the command line, patch will try to
     figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file to edit is.
     When checking a prospective file name, pathname components are stripped
	 as specified by the -p option and the file's existence and writability
	 are checked relative to the current working directory (or the directory
	 specified by the -d option).

	 If the diff is a context or unified diff, patch is able to determine the
	 old and new file names from the diff header.  For context diffs, the
	 “old” file is specified in the line beginning with "***" and the “new”
	 file is specified in the line beginning with "---".  For a unified diff,
	 the “old” file is specified in the line beginning with "---" and the
	 “new” file is specified in the line beginning with "+++".	If there is an
	 "Index": line in the leading garbage (regardless of the diff type), patch
	 will use the file name from that line as the “index” file.

	 patch will choose the file name by performing the following steps, with
	 the first match used:

	 1.   If patch is operating in strict IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”)
	  mode, the first of the “old”, “new” and “index” file names that
	  exist is used.

	 2.   If patch is not operating in strict IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”)
	  mode, and a non-zero --get argument has been supplied, then patch
	  will choose one of the “index”, “old” or “new” filenames that are
	  detected to exist under a version control system.  Otherwise, patch
	  will examine either the “old” and “new” file names or, for a non-
	  context diff, the “index” file name, and choose the file name with
	  the fewest path components, the shortest basename, and the shortest
	  total file name length (in that order).

	 3.   If no suitable file was found to patch, the patch file is a context
	  or unified diff, and the old file was zero length, the new file name
	  is created and used.

	 4.   If the file name still cannot be determined, patch will prompt the
	  user for the file name to use.

	 Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a "Prereq: " line, patch
	 will take the first word from the prerequisites line (normally a version
	 number) and check the input file to see if that word can be found.  If
	 not, patch will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

	 The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in a news
	 interface, the following:

	   | patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl

	 and patch a file in the blurfl directory directly from the article
	 containing the patch.

   Backup Files
	 By default, the patched version is put in place of the original, with the
	 original file backed up to the same name with the extension ".orig", or
	 as specified by the -B, -V, or -z options.  The extension used for making
	 backup files may also be specified in the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX
	 environment variable, which is overridden by the options above.

	 If the backup file is a symbolic or hard link to the original file, patch
	 creates a new backup file name by changing the first lowercase letter in
	 the last component of the file's name into uppercase.  If there are no
     more lowercase letters in the name, it removes the first character from
     the name.	It repeats this process until it comes up with a backup file
     that does not already exist or is not linked to the original file.

     You may also specify where you want the output to go with the -o option;
     if that file already exists, it is backed up first.

   Notes For Patch Senders
     There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be
     sending out patches:

     First, you can save people a lot of grief by keeping a patchlevel.h file
     which is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff in the
     patch file you send out.  If you put a "Prereq": line in with the patch,
     it will not let them apply patches out of order without some warning.

     Second, make sure you have specified the file names right, either in a
     context diff header, or with an "Index": line.  If you are patching
     something in a subdirectory, be sure to tell the patch user to specify a
     -p option as needed.

     Third, you can create a file by sending out a diff that compares a null
     file to the file you want to create.  If the file you want to create
     already exists in the target directory when the diff is applied, then
     patch will identify the patch as potentially reversed and offer to
     reverse the patch.

     Fourth, take care not to send out reversed patches, since it makes people
     wonder whether they already applied the patch.

     Fifth, while you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings
     into one file, it is probably wiser to group related patches into
     separate files in case something goes haywire.
